<h1 id="initial-considerations">Initial considerations</h1>

<p>It is good to take a moment to consider some of the important aspects of your Symbiota2 plugin before 
beginning the actual work of creating it. Having a basic idea of the general architecture of your plugin
prior to writing any code can save time in the development process and help avoid making mistakes. Some 
important items to consider include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Selecting a name for your plugin</strong> - 
  Every Symbiota2 plugin needs to have a name that is unique in order to identify it uniquely within 
  the software. The name must be unique to all of the plugins listed in the <a href="https://github.com/Symbiota2/Symbiota2/blob/master/plugin-registry.json">plugin registry</a>
  and to all additional plugins that are installed within a Symbiota2 portal. Plugin names cannot not 
  contain spaces and it is suggested to use all lower-case letters. Additionally, plugins cannot start
  with the prefix <code class="highlighter-rouge">symbiota-</code> or be named <code class="highlighter-rouge">core</code>, which are reserved for core Symbiota2 libraries. To ensure that your plugin name will
  be unique, it is suggested to use a developer-specific or project-specific prefix with your plugin name,
  such as “my_name-plugin_name”. Review the <a href="./plugin_registry.html">plugin registry documentation</a>
  for further information regarding the registry.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dependencies required by your plugin</strong> - 
  If your plugin is going to rely on other Symbiota2 plugins in order to operate as intended, you must
  identify those plugins as dependencies for your plugin. This does not include the Symbiota2 core libraries,
  which are included as part of the core Symbiota2 application. Any other plugin that is utilized by your plugin,
  either through utilizing API endpoints in the backend, or services or components in the frontend, must be defined
  as a dependency. Dependencies are defined within the <a href="./plugin_config.html">plugin config file</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Backend elements of your plugin</strong> - 
  If your plugin is going to include backend elements, including additions to the data schema, it is good to
  consider the architecture of these elements and how they will integrate within the greater Symbiota2
  architecture. Symbiota2 uses the <a href="https://api-platform.com/" target="_blank">API Platform Framework</a>, which utilizes 
  the <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/current/index.html" target="_blank">Symfony Framework</a>, in its backend. So all backend 
  elements must adhere to both of those frameworks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Frontend elements of your plugin</strong> - 
  If your plugin is going to include frontend elements, it is good to consider the architecture of these elements 
  as well and how they will integrate within the greater Symbiota2 architecture. Symbiota2 uses the <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank">Angular Framework</a>,
  in its frontend, so all frontend elements must adhere to this frameworks. Additionally, it is good to also consider
  whether you will offer i18n internationalization support for your plugin, and if so, which languages you will support.
  The core application and associated optional plugins of the Symbiota2 project provide default i18n internationalization 
  support for English, Arabic, Chinese, Farsi, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and 
  Urdu. All plugins that offer i18n internationalization support must offer support for English, but all other supported 
  languages are optional and the only limit being each language must have a <a href="https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php" target="_blank">ISO 639-1 code associated with it</a>.
  Symbiota2 uses the <a href="http://www.ngx-translate.com" target="_blank">ngx-translate library</a> to incorporate i18n internationalization 
  support within its frontend components. All i18n internationalization support needs to be incorporated according to 
  the <a href="https://www.codeandweb.com/babeledit/tutorials/how-to-translate-your-angular8-app-with-ngx-translate" target="_blank">ngx-translate suggested workflows</a>.</p>
