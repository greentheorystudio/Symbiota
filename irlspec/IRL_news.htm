        Jellyfish Makes Its First Appearance in the IRL</font></b></p>
  </center>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">The Australian spotted jellyfish, <i>Phyllorhiza
        punctata</i>, made its first documented appearance in the northern
        Indian River Lagoon in late June. Biologists Lauren Hall and Shelly
        Heidelbaugh of the St. Johns River Water Management District observed 2
        specimens while surveying seagrass beds in Brevard
        County.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the specimens was collected for
        identification and further examination. A subsequent aerial survey over
        north Indian River and Banana River was conducted in the first week of
        July to estimate population centers and the number of individuals
        present. Approximately 2 dozen animals were sighted during the flight,
        leading researchers to estimate the Phyllorhiza population at that time
        numbered between 300 - 500 individuals. Animals were concentrated on
        both sides of Merrit Island, between the Eau Gallie Causeway and State
        Road 520. None of the animals was observed south of Melbourne Beach.</font></p>
      <i>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000080">Phyllorhiza punctata</font></i><font color="#000080">
      is native to the waters off Australia, and is considered invasive in the
      United States. The species was first documented in parts of the Caribbean
      some 30 years ago, where non-explosive populations became established and
      still persist today. <i>Phyllorhiza</i> first appeared in the Gulf of
      Mexico in June of 2000 along the coasts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and
      Alabama. First spotted in Mobile Bay in June, by late summer, commercial
      fishermen were reporting shrimp nets clogged with spotted jellies within a
      95 square-mile area of the Gulf. Dr. Monty Graham of the Dauphin Island
      Sea Lab in Alabama reported that aerial surveys of the Gulf population
      revealed dense aggregations of <i>Phyllorhiza </i>measuring approximately
      100 m across, and as much as 1 kilometer in length. Graham estimated that
      some of these aggregations contained as many as 50 individuals per square
      meter. However, <i>Phyllorhiza </i>blooms are largely<i> </i>seasonal in
      nature, and by later September, the Gulf bloom had dissipated.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000080">Spotted jellyfish, like their native
      counterparts in Florida, are voracious eaters that consume small fish
      eggs, larvae, and other <a href="#microzooplankton" onclick="popDef('Small animals, eggs, and larvae suspended inthe water column', '#micorzooplankton');" name="microzooplankton">microzooplankton</a>. Thus, their appearance in the
      Gulf of Mexico caused some concern among ecologists and members of the
      general public, who feared that an established population of <i>Phyllorhiza
      </i>could be potentially damaging to fish and shrimp stocks. Fortunately,
      the population explosion of last summer was not repeated this summer;
      though some animals are present, their numbers are significantly reduced.
      Researchers speculate that environmental conditions in the Gulf may not
      have been optimal for <i>Phyllorhiza </i>to establish a viable,
      self-sustaining population.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000080">There is some reason to speculate
      that the Indian River Lagoon may be a somewhat more hospitable habitat for
      <i>Phyllorhiza </i>than the Gulf&nbsp;</font>

        <p><br>
        <font color="#000080">of Mexico. Spotted jellies in the waters off
        Australia, and those that have become naturalized in the Caribbean,
        generally have zooxanthellae, a type of symbiotic algae, resident within
        their tissues. While none of the specimens collected in the Gulf of
        Mexico last summer were found to have zooxanthellae, the few specimens
        examined from the IRL did. However, the population explosion observed in
        the Gulf of Mexico last year has not been repeated in the Indian River
        Lagoon this year. Rather, sighting reports have dropped off
        significantly according to the St. Johns River Water Management District
        which had set up a hotline (1-800-226-3747) for <i>Phyllorhiza </i>sightings.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">The question which causes the most
        concern for researchers is whether or not the spotted jellyfish will be
        able to establish a resident population in the Indian River Lagoon. The
        occurrence of this potentially damaging invasive species will certainly
        warrant further monitoring throughout the next few summers; but for this
        summer, the occurrence of <i>Phyllorhiza punctata</i> along Florida's
        east coast can be viewed as an ecological curiosity rather than an
        ecological disaster.</font>
