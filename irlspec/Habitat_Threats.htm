    <p class="title">IRL Mangroves</p>
    <p class="body">Impounding
        of salt marshes and mangrove forests is likely the most broadly
        reaching and destructive disturbance in these coastal Florida ecosystems
        (Montague &amp; Wiegert 1990). <br />
        Before mosquito control methods like
        impoundments were in place, mosquito landings were among the highest
        densities ever recorded in the continental United States (Provost
        1949), reaching 500 per person per minute in some areas of Florida
        (Leenhouts 1983).</p>
      <p class="body">Ditching in marshes in the 1930s was ineffective,
        and the use of DDT pesticide in the 1940s had adverse effects on
        wildlife (Montague &amp; Wiegert 1990). In the 1950s, impounding
        marshes became an effective and seemingly less invasive way to control
        mosquitoes. Using this method, salt marshes and intertidal mangroves
        are closed off to tidal influences and the water is pumped out,
        allowing mosquitoes to lay eggs on exposed sediment. The impoundments
        are then flooded to kill eggs and larvae. Today, 192 impoundments
        are active on the east coast of Florida alone (Rey &amp; Kain 1989).
        Many of these areas are still closed systems that allow influx of
        freshwater from precipitation and runoff, creating wide variations
        in salinity. This, along with the flooding process, can cause dieback
        of natural vegetation and establishment of more oligohaline species.
        Breeding and spawning behaviors of fishes and invertebrates can
        also be restricted in closed systems.</p>
      <p class="body">One of the most devastating
        effects of impounding was to the dusky seaside sparrow, <em>Ammodramas
          maritimus nigrescens</em>, which was driven to extinction in 1987
        (Kale 1996). Currently, several areas have begun operating on a
        rotational impoundment management (RIM) approach (David 1992). The
        RIM plan allows impoundments to be open to regular tidal flows and
        wildlife migrations during non-breeding months. <br />
        From May to August,
        impoundments are closed to control mosquito reproduction. The addition
        of culverts to enhance tidal cycles in open impoundments (known
        as breached-RIM or restored areas) have helped to increase biodiversity,
        correct chemical values for sediments and to re-establish common
        vegetation (Brockmeyer <em>et al.</em> 1997, Klassen 1998, Poulakis <em>et al.</em> 2002, Rey &amp; Cain 1993).</p>
      <p class="body">Mangrove species seem
        to respond differently to RIM and restored areas. For example, the
        red mangrove, <a href="taxa/Rhizop_mangle.htm"><em>Rhizophora mangle</em></a>,
        reaches higher densities in RIM and restored impoundments; whereas,
        the black mangrove, <a href="taxa/Avicen_germin.htm"><em>Avicennia germinans</em></a>,
        grows best in natural undeveloped areas (Middleton <em>et al.</em> 2008). More information on mosquito impoundments can be found by
        navigating to the impoundment link on the main habitat page.</p>
      <p class="title">Shoreline Development</p><br />
      <p class="body">Land
          use changes from the growing population and urbanization in Florida
          and throughout the world have altered coastal ecosystems. <br />
          In Florida,
          mangroves have been removed and both these areas and salt marshes
          have been filled with dredged material to create roads, residential
          communities and businesses. <br />
          Habitat fragmentation has occurred from
          this development, fracturing animal communities and leaving ecosystems
          more vulnerable to other habitat disturbances (Larson 1995). Fortunately,
          substantial mangroves and salt marshes lay within protected areas
          such as the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge and property
          managed by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. Proper
          management provides conservation from further development and encourages
          restoration programs that work to increase habitat acreage.</p>
      <p class="title">Muck &amp; Nutrients</p>
        <p class="body">Accumulations
          of fine-grained, organic-rich clays and silt known as muck are introduced
          to coastal environments from terrestrial and industrial runoff.
          Muck generally settles into depressions in the sediment, and can
          reach up to 2 m deep in some areas of the IRL (Trefry <em>et al.</em> 1990). Disturbance from boat traffic, wind and waves can suspend
          muck, creating particulates that cloud the water, reducing sunlight
          penetration and retarding plant and algal growth (Trefry <em>et
            al.</em> 2007). <br />
            Transported in the water column by currents, muck
          can settle in salt marshes and mangrove forests, possibly smothering
          young vegetation. Muck accrual in the IRL has been ongoing for the
          past 40 to 60 years. Although less than 10% of the IRL bottom was
          covered in muck in 1990, coverage continues to grow (Trefry <em>et
            al.</em> 1990, Trefry <em>et al.</em> 2007).</p>
      <p class="body">In addition to the
        physical stresses caused by this sediment accumulation, muck carries
        large quantities of nutrients and toxic substances that can create
        health problems or death for a variety of aquatic organisms. Excess
        nitrogen and phosphorous can alter the dominant plants in marshes
        and mangroves, allowing some species to thrive outside of their
        natural elevation (Levine <em>et al.</em> 1998). Recently, dredging
        projects in isolated areas of the lagoon, including the St. Sebastian
        River, Turkey Creek and Crane Creek, have successfully removed thousands
        of cubic meters of muck, along with harmful chemicals like pesticides
        that are incorporated into the sediment (Trefry &amp; Trocine 2002).
        <br />
        Coupled with decreases in terrestrial and industrial runoff, further
        dredging projects could result in long-term reductions of muck throughout
        the IRL.</p>
      <p class="title">Invasive Species</p>
      <p class="body">Bioinvasions
          have become high profile issues affecting ecosystem dynamics in
          both aquatic and terrestrial environments. Because salt marshes
          and mangroves are unique mixtures of both habitats, invasive species
          from land and sea pose threats to biodiversity and ecosystem health.
          In Florida, the introduced nutria, <em>Myocastor coypus</em>, contributes
          to the loss of marsh acreage by foraging on vegetation (Ford &amp;
          Grace 1998). Changes in water flow around salt marshes and mangroves
          have allowed for expansion of the invading Brazilian pepper, <a href="taxa/Schinus_terebinthifolius.htm"><em>Schinus
            terebinthifolius</em></a>, and the Australian pine, <a href="taxa/Casuarina_equisetifolia.htm"><em>Casuarina
              equistifolia</em></a>. Closing portions of these habitats for mosquito
          impoundments has reduced the salinity, allowing the invasion of
          more oligohaline vegetation and animals (FWS 1999) such as the blackchin
          tilapia, <em><a href="taxa/Sarotherodon_melanotheron.htm">Sarotherodon
            melanotheron</a></em> (Faunce <em>et al.</em> 1999, Poulakis <em>et
              al.</em> 2002). Furthermore, disturbed or barren areas will often
          be colonized by invasives before native plants can become established.
          Efforts are ongoing to remove invasive plants from terrestrial areas,
          but aquatic invasions of fishes and invertebrates are often difficult
          or impossible to reverse, and can only be managed to prevent further
          range expansion.</p>

      <p class="title">Hurricanes</p>
      <p class="body">Salt marshes, mangroves and other coastal ecosystems
        can usually recover quickly from natural disturbances such as fire
        and hurricanes. However, when disturbance events occur in close
        succession, they may have lasting effects on the ecosystems. Hurricanes
        produce storm surges, wind and waves that can impact mangroves and
        marshes in several ways. Upper marshes and mangrove swamps can experience
        an influx of seawater at a salinity to which vegetation is not accustomed,
        causing dieback of several plant species. Wind can strip trees and
        bushes of foliage and damage the trunk. The white mangrove, <a href="taxa/Lagunc_racemo.htm"><em>Laguncularia
          racemosa</em></a>, is the mangrove species most susceptible to wind
        damage (Doyle <em>et al.</em> 1995). <br />
        In addition, lower elevations
        can experience extreme rates of sedimentation or erosion. Sediment
        erosion can wash away much of the vegetation, reducing habitat acreage.
        However, sediment accretion could be more harmful, essentially covering
        marsh and mangrove areas (Rejmanek<em> et al.</em> 1998) and smothering
        sessile benthic invertebrates. One example of rapid sedimentation
        occurred in the upper Chesapeake Bay, when over a 70-year period
        50% of the sediment accumulation was attributed to one flood event
        and a single hurricane (Schubel &amp; Hirschberg 1978). Regeneration
        of mangrove forests following substantial storm damage may take
        decades, and restored swamps may have altered biodiversity and plant
        zonation (Ellison &amp; Farnsworth 1990).</p>

      <p class="title">Sea Level Rise</p>
        <p class="body">Much
          attention has been given to the effects of rising sea level on coastal
          ecosystems throughout the world. As intertidal communities, salt
          marshes and mangroves are at risk from both the amplitude and rate
          of this rise. For the ecosystems to thrive, they must occur at the
          appropriate elevation and slope. In fact, one of the most common
          reasons for restoration failure in salt marshes is choosing an improper
          site based on these parameters (Crewz &amp; Lewis 1991). As sea
          level rises, it is possible for marshes and mangroves to shift in
          a landward direction if the rate of rise is slow enough for sediment
          accretion to occur (Montague &amp; Wiegert 1990). However, coastal
          development and steep terrain may inhibit plant migration, changing
          zonation in these habitats or flooding them completely. In addition,
          compression of the intertidal zone can lead to increased interspecific
          competition and loss of biodiversity. See <a href="Climate_Change.htm">Climate Change and the IRL</a>.</p>
