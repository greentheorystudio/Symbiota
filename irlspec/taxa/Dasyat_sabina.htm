<p class="title">Species Description</p>
<p class="body">The Atlantic Stingray, <i>Dasyatis sabina</i>, is a
small ray distributed throughout shallow water habitats in the southeastern
United States. Body color on the dorsal surface ranges from a medium brown to
dark brown, and is generally uniform. The ventral surface is white. Rays are
dorsoventrally flattened, with pectoral fins expanded toward, and fusing with
the head. Gill openings are ventral in all rays. The caudal and dorsal fins are
reduced or absent in some species.</p>
<p class="body">There are 9 genera in the Dasyatidae family, most of
which posses a hardened spine or barb near the base of the tail. Of the
spine-bearing species, including <i>Dasyatis sabina</i>, many have
venom-secreting cells which may be either glandular or scattered throughout the
integumentary sheath surrounding the spine (Bond 1996; Amesbury and Snelson
1997).</p>

<p class="title">Potentially misidentified species</p>
<p class="body">Can be confused with the <a href="#sympatric" onClick="popDef('Used of species or taxa which overlap in their geographical ranges', '#sympatric');" name="sympatric">sympatric</a> species <i>Dasyatis sayi</i> and <i>Dasyatis americana</i>.</p>
    	  </li>
  <li>
  	<p class="heading">HABITAT AND DISTRIBUTION</p>
    <p class="title">Regional Occurrence</p>
<p class="body">The Atlantic Stingray, <i>Dasyatis
sabina,</i> is distributed along the Atlantic coast from Chesapeake Bay to South
Florida and the Gulf of Mexico. It is most abundant throughout coastal waters in
Florida, but also has stable populations in Georgia, Louisiana and Texas.
Although <i>D. sabina</i> has been reported to occur in some areas of South
America, it is believed that these reports resulted from misidentification of
specimens (Lee et al. 1980; Robins and Ray 1986).</p>

<p class="title">IRL Distribution</p>
<p class="body"><i>D. sabina</i> occurs throughout the Indian River Lagoon, and is most common in shallow water
habitats. It is one of 3 species of ray occurring in the IRL. The others are <i>D. americana</i> and <i>D. sayi</i> (Snelson 1988).</p>
</li>
   <li>
   		<p class="heading">LIFE HISTORY AND POPULATION BIOLOGY</p>
      <p class="title">Age, Size, Lifespan</p>
<p class="body"><i>Dasyatis sabina</i>
has a life span of approximately 9 years, and achieves a size of 60 cm DW (disc
width, or the width of the body including the pectoral fins, but excluding the
tail), and 109 cm TL (total length). Snelson et al. (1988) reported a maximum
male size for Florida <i>Dasyatis</i> of 32.6 cm DW. The largest females were 37
cm DW. Maximum body weight for males was approximately 1.6 kg, while for
females, it was 2.2 kg.</p>
<p class="title"><b>Abundance</p>
<p class="body"><i>D. sabina</i> is the most abundant and widely distributed ray in shallow water estuaries (Snelson et al. 1988: Maruska and Tricas 1996).</p>
<p class="title"><b>Reproduction</p>
<p class="body">Sex ratios in Florida populations of <i>D. sabina</i>
are approximately 1:1. Males mature at approximately 2 years of age, after they
have achieved a size of 20 cm DW. Females mature at a slightly larger body size
of between 22 - 24 cm DW (Snelson et al. 1988; Johnson and Snelson 1996). <i>Dasyatis
sabina</i> has the longest preovulatory mating period reported for any
elasmobranch (Kajiura et al. 2000). Mating takes place between October and April
in Florida, with a peak in March (Snelson et al. 1988; Maruska et al. 1996;
Kajiura et al. 2000). Testes are active from September through March, with peak
sperm production from August through January. Egg development in females occurs
over 5 -6 months. Ovulation occurs almost synchronously among females in a
population in late March and early April, with young being born in late July or
early August following a 3.5 - 4 month gestation period. Brood size is between 1
- 4, with an average of approximately 2.6. Neonates are 10 - 13 cm DW.</p>
<p class="body">Before the onset of the breeding season, changes in
male tooth morphology occur. In the non-mating season, male tooth structure is
similar to that of females, being principally rounded and molariform. However,
as breeding season approaches, male teeth become sharp and narrow for improved
grasping of females (Kajiura et al. 2000; Kajiura and Tricas 1996) and
subsequent internal fertilization. Mating behavior in <i>D. sabina</i> follows
the general pattern for sharks and rays. During early courtship, males follow
closely behind females, biting at their bodies and pectoral fins (Kajiura et al.
2000; Tricas 1980). When breeding is initiated, males grasp the pectoral fins of
females with their teeth to assist in providing leverage for clasper insertion
and for body alignment. It is thought that this fin gripping behavior is a
precopulatory <a href="#releasing mechanism" onClick="popDef('Any stimulus that serves to initiate some instinctive behavior or programmed response in an organism', '#releasing mechanism')" name="releasing mechanism">releasing mechanism</a> that facilitates female cooperation in
breeding (Kajiura and Tricas 1996).</p>
<p class="title"><b>Embryology</p>
<p class="body">The developmental mode in <i>D. sabina</i> is
aplacental viviparity, meaning that once the supply of yolk in an egg has been
depleted, nourishment to the embryo is provided from maternal secretions, though
not via a placenta (Bond 1996). Yolk sacs in this species weigh up to 10 times
that of an early embryo and are fully absorbed by day 60, approximately 75% of
the total gestation period of 3.5 - 4 months (Johnson and Snelson 1996).
Following absorption of the yolk sac, embryos are fully dependent upon
secretions of uterine milk, or histotroph, from glandular cells in the female.</p>
<p class="body">Embryos first become recognizable at approximately 4-6
weeks post ovulation and measure 8.6 mm TL (total length), or approximately 1.2
mm DW (disc width). Early embryos do not have the characteristic rounded or oval
appearance of most stingrays, but rather, are elongate and resemble sharks. At
this stage, the eyes and olfactory bulb in the head region are undeveloped, and
the external gill filaments first begin to emerge. At 1.8 mm DW, pectoral fins
begin to develop and expand laterally toward the posterior region of the body.
The head is ventrally flexed at this stage, and the external gills become more
fully enlarged. By 3.6 mm DW, the pelvic fins begin to develop, and the pectoral
fins begin to expand toward the head. At 5.0 mm DW, the eyes develop, and become
pigmented when the embryo has reached approximately 7.0 mm DW and becomes
dorsoventrally flattened. Growth after this stage is rapid, with body weight
increasing as much as 100 fold. By the time embryos attain a size of 40 mm DW,
they can be sexed, because the presence of claspers becomes obvious in males. At
60 mm DW, the tail spine first begins to emerge. At 70 mm DW, embryos are
morphologically similar to adults. Neonates are approximately 100mm DW (Johnson
and Snelson 1996).</p>

   	<p class="heading">PHYSICAL TOLERANCES</p>
    <p class="title">Temperature</p>
<p class="body"><i>D. sabina</i> is sensitive to colder temperatures but tolerates higher temperatures up to 35&deg;C
well. The critical thermal minimum for this species is estimated to be 15 - 17
 &deg;C (Snelson et al. 1988). Snelson et al. (1988) reported that it became harder
to locate <i>D. sabina</i> in winter months when water temperatures drop below
15  &deg;C because many individuals were believed to migrate into the deeper water
of channels and holes.</p>

<p class="title">Salinity</p>
<p class="body"><i>D. sabina</i> is a
common inhabitant of shallow estuaries, but also strays into freshwater areas.
It is broadly <a href="#euryhaline" onClick="popDef('Organisms tolerant of widely ranging salinity', '#euryhaline');" name="euryhaline">euryhaline</a>. Salinity in the IRL can range from approximately 7 - 45 <a href="#ppt" onClick="popDef('Parts per thousand', '#ppt');" name="ppt">ppt</a>. <i>D.
sabina</i> tolerates this range well, showing no obvious signs of discomfort in
response to changing salinity, even when subjected to rapid changes (Snelson et
al. 1988). The only known permanent freshwater population of <i>D. sabina</i>
occurs in the southern (upper) reaches of the St. John's River, Florida, more
than 350 km from the coast. The St. John's population completes its entire life
cycle in freshwater, in spite of there being no physical barrier to fish
migration. Many have speculated as to how this population may have come into
existence. The possibility exists that the St. John's population is perhaps a
remnant of the estuarine population that inhabited the area when sea level was
higher, and the St. John's River basin was a brackish coastal lagoon (Amesbury
and Snelson 1997). If this is indeed the case, then the St. John's population
may have begun a genetic separation from the estuarine population as early as
the late Pleistocene (Cook 1939; Amesbury and Snelson 1997). Johnson and Snelson
(1996) have suggested that one major reason why <i>D. sabina</i> is able to
maintain a permanent population in the St. John's River is that the surrounding
river basin has a high content of Pleistocene mineral salt deposits that
increase chloride levels in otherwise freshwater systems.</p>
<p class="body">In comparing freshwater and marine adapted <i>D. sabina</i>,
Piermarini and Evans (1998) noted that the salt-secreting rectal glands in the
freshwater rays from the St. John's River had a gland weight to body weight
ratio that was 80% lower than those found in marine <i>D. sabina</i>. Since
there is less of a need to excrete excess salts in a fresh water environment,
freshwater elasmobranchs have adapted decreased size and function in their
rectal glands. Further, many freshwater elasmobranchs have serum/plasma urea
levels that are 30 - 50% lower than in marine species (Piermarini and Evans
1998).</p>
</li>
   <li>
   	<p class="heading">COMMUNITY ECOLOGY</p>
	<p class="title">Trophic Mode</p>
<p class="body">The diet of <i>D. sabina</i> is composed primarily
of <a href="#benthic" onClick="popDef('describes organisms living in or on lakebeds, riverbeds or the seafloor', '#benthic');" name="benthic">benthic</a> invertebrates such as anemones, Polychaete worms, amphipods, mysids,
isopods, bivalves, and the calcified discs of brittlestars (Turner et al. 1982;
Cook 1994; Kajiura and Tricas 1996).</p>

<p class="body"><i>D. sabina</i> is a highly
<a href="#electroreceptive" onClick="popDef('Able to detect electrical fields around other organisms', '#electroreceptive');" name="electroreceptive">electroreceptive</a> fish having bilateral rows of neuromasts (sensory cells) that
detect water motion over the dorsal surface, and a pored ventral canal system
composed of ampullae of Lorenzini (see Bond 1996) that function in detecting
and localizing prey (Maruska and Tricas 1998). Living prey of any species give
off characteristic electrical potentials which can be detected by the ampullae
of Lorenzini. <i>D. sabina</i> uses this electrical input to aim strikes at
potential prey buried in the substratum (Blonder and Alevizon 1988).</p>
<p class="body"><a href="#Olfaction" onClick="popDef('The sense of smell', '#Olfaction');" name="Olfaction" id="Olfaction">Olfaction</a> is also used in combination with
electroreception to detect prey (Maruska and Tricas 1998). Feeding behavior
involves the ray slowly swimming approximately 0.1 - 0.2 m above the surface of
sand bottoms, followed by abrupt stops to evaluate an area for the presence of
prey items. To inspect an area, the ray lies motionless on top of the sand. If
prey is detected, the ray begins an undulatory movement of its pelvic fins to
mechanically excavate prey from the benthos. Excavation creates a feeding
depression which helps retain prey. Deep dwelling prey such a polychaete worms
are further exposed by increased mouth suction. Prey consumption involves rapid
biting motions of the jaws, and movement in the spiracles and gills (Maruska and
Tricas 1998).</p>
<p class="title">Competitors</p>
<p class="body">Competes for benthic prey with other ray species
and with fishes that feed on similar prey items.</p>
<p class="title">Habitats</p>
<p class="body"><i>D. sabina</i> is
typically considered abundant to common in shallow estuarine waters less than 1
m in depth (Snelson et al. 1988). Preferred habitat areas have bottoms of sand
or silt, and include shoreline, spoil islands, and seagrass beds. <i>D. sabina</i>
exhibits pronounced seasonal movement patterns. From Spring through Fall, it is
typically found in inshore shallows. During late Fall and Winter, it migrates
into the deeper water of channels and holes. It resumes its normal activities
when water temperatures return to 16 - 18 &deg;C (Snelson et al. 1988). In spite
of its ability to migrate, <i>D. sabina</i> shows high site fidelity and does
not often migrate from the IRL (Johnson and Snelson 1996).</p>
<p class="title">Activity Time</p>
<p class="body"><i>D. sabina</i> has
been shown to feed almost continuously throughout both daylight and evening
hours (Bradley 1996 in Maruska and Tricas 1996).</p>

     <p class="heading">ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>
     <p class="title">Broad Scale Cost/Benefit</p>
<p class="body">Because of their venomous caudal spines, <i>D.
sabina</i> is often considered to be a nuisance species. However, in recent
years, it has become valuable as a research model in biomedical research,
neurobiology and physiological research (Ritchie and Leonard 1983; Grondel and
Zimmerman 1986; Snelson et al. 1988). Additionally, it is an important component
of lagoonal <a href="#epibenthic" onClick="popDef('Describes organisms living at the surface of the substratum in a lakebed, riverbed or on the seafloor', '#epibenthic');" name="epibenthic">epibenthic</a> fish communities.</p>
