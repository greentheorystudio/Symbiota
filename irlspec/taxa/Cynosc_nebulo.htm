            <p class="title">Species Description</p>
              <p class="body"><em>Cynoscion nebulosus</em>, the spotted seatrout is an elongate,
              fusiform member of the drum family that reaches a maximum length
              of 100 cm (3.3 feet). Body color is silvery, with the dorsal surface
              a darker gray tinged with blue. Many small black spots are scattered
              over the dorsal surface of the body above the lateral line and extend
              onto the dorsal and caudal fins. The spinous dorsal fin is dusky
              in color, while all other fins are pale to yellowish in color. The
              dorsal fin has 12 spines and 25-28 soft rays, with the spinous portion
              of the fin separated from the soft dorsal fin by a deep notch. The
              anal fin has 2 spines and 10-11 rays. The caudal fin is truncate
              or emarginate. The head is slightly concave in profile, with the
              large mouth set obliquely and the lower jaw projecting beyond the
              upper. The inside of the mouth is orange. The upper jaw has a large
              pair of canine teeth at set at the front, while the lower jaw has
              an enlarged inner row of close-set teeth. The snout has 2 marginal
              pores. There are no chin barbells. Scales large and ctenoid, covering
              most of the body surface except the soft dorsal and anal fins, which
              lack scales. The lateral line extends into the caudal fin and has
              66 or more lateral line scales. There are 7-9 gill rakers on lower
              limb of the gill arch, with rakers relatively short and thick in
              comparison with other <em>Cynoscion</em> species (Hoese and Moore
              1977; Johnson and Seaman 1986).</p>

              <p class="title">Potentially Misidentified Species</p>
              <p class="body"><em>Cynoscion nebulosus</em> may be confused with others of its
              genus, particularly the weakfish, <em>C. regalis</em>. However,
              its distinctive pattern of black spots scattered along the upper
              body and extending into the caudal and dorsal fins, easily distinguish
              it from <em>C. regalis</em> and other seatrout. </p>

  	<p class="heading">HABITAT AND DISTRIBUTION</p>
    <p class="title">Regional Occurrence</p>
              <p class="body">Spotted seatrout range along the U.S. coast from Massachusetts south
              through Florida and into the Gulf of Mexico to Texas and Mexico.
              The center of abundance is the northern Gulf of Mexico and Florida
              (Pearson 1929).</p>
            <p class="title">IRL Distribution</p>
              <p class="body"><em>Cynoscion nebulosus</em> occurs throughout the IRL, but tends
              to be more abundant in its northern reaches, in the vicinity of
              Cape Canaveral.</p>
            <p class="body">Using molecular techniques, FWRI scientists
              have developed nuclear DNA evidence for 3 distinct groups of spotted
              seatrout in Florida waters (Seyoum and Bert, unpubl, FWRI). One
              group occurs from the Florida-Georgia border south to Biscayne Bay.
              The second group occurs from Biscayne Bay south through Florida
              Bay and northward to Steinhatchee on the Gulf coast. The third group
              occurs from Apalachicola westward into the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

   		<p class="heading">LIFE HISTORY AND POPULATION BIOLOGY</p>
      <p class="title">Age, Size, Lifespan</p>
              <p class="body">The spotted seatrout grows to a maximum size of approximately 100
              cm (3.3 feet) total length (TL) and may weigh as much as 7.9 kg
              (17.4 pounds). The lifespan is approximately 18 years (Hoese and
              Moore 1977; Johnson and Seaman 1986).</p>
            <p class="body">Throughout Florida, young males outnumber
              young females, but females tend to live longer than males (Klima
              1959; Moffett 1961; Rutherford et al. 1982). Based on growth ring
              analysis of scales, females also tend to grow somewhat faster than
              males (Moffett 1961), with growth averaging 0.7 - 13 cm (0.3 - 5.1
              inches) per year, depending on age. Rutherford et al. (1982) reported
              growth is fastest during the first year, with a growth rate of approximately
              21.2 cm (8.3 inches). This rate slows to approximately 4-5 cm (1.6
              - 2 inches) per year for fish Ages II - IV. In the oldest fishes
              studied, growth slowed to approximately 2.2 cm (0.8 inches) per
              year.</p>
            <p class="body">Growth rates in <em>Cynoscion nebulosus</em>
              are temperature dependent, generally slowing or stopping completely
              in the winter months due to slowing metabolism and reduced feeding
              (Guest and Gunter 1958; Tabb 1961). Growth rates are highest in
              July and August (Pearson 1929; Moffett 1961).</p>
            <p class="body">Murphy and Taylor (1994) estimated length-weight
              relationships among spotted seatrout in different regions of Florida.
              They reported that in all areas, males are heavier than females
              of the same length. Further, there was some difference between estuaries
              in terms of weight at any given length, with fishes from the Indian
              River Lagoon and Apalachicola Bay tending to be heavier than seatrout
              collected from Charlotte Harbor.</p>
            <p class="title">Reproduction</p>
              <p class="body">Spotted seatrout mature at 1-4 years of age (Lorio and Perret 1980).
              Tabb (1961) reported that in the IRL, females mature at 3-4 years
              of age, while males mature at 2-3 years of age. Females tend to
              be larger at maturity than are males (Moody 1950; Moffett 1961).
              Length at maturity varies by region; however, most spotted seatrout
              spawn at 24-25 cm (9.4 - 9.8 inches) standard length (Moody 1950).
          </p>
            <p class="body"><em>Cynoscion nebulosus</em> spawn in nearshore
              and estuarine waters (Mercer 1984; Johnson and Seaman 1986). They
              are multiple spawners, as evidenced by the presence of vitellogenic
              and fully yolked eggs in ovaries throughout the spawning season
              (Brown-Peterson et al. 1988). The average time between successive
              spawns was reported by Brown-Peterson et al. (1988) as 3.6 days,
              though data from an experimental aquaculture population yielded
              a period between spawns of 21 days (Tucker and Faulkner 1987). This
              indicates that a female may spawn 9 - 60 times in a spawning season,
              and release 3 - 20 million eggs annually (Murphy et al. 1999).</p>
            <p class="body">Spawning occurs at somewhat different times
              depending on location. In Florida, spotted seatrout in the Ft. Myers
              area spawn from late March through September, with a peak in June
              (Moody 1950, Moffett 1961). In the Indian River Lagoon, spawning
              occurs from mid-April through July, peaking from April - June (Tabb
              1961), though some data indicates year-round spawning within the
              IRL (Murphy and Taylor, FMRI, unpubl in Murphy et al. 1999). In
              the Everglades, evidence indicates year-round spawning that peaks
              both in spring and from late summer to early fall. (Jannke 1971;
              Rutherford et al. 1982). Time of spawning is controlled by temperature
              and salinity, with spotted seatrout in most areas spawning in waters
              where temperatures are 25 - 28&ordm;C, and salinity is 30 - 35 ppt
              (Johnson and Seaman 1986).</p>
            <p class="body">Fecundity increases with size in <em>Cynoscion
              nebulosus</em>. In Florida, Moody (1957) reported a 39.7 cm (15.6
              inches) female collected at Cedar Key contained 464,000 eggs. Tabb
              (1961) reported 15,000 - 1.1 million eggs per female from a collection
              of females, aged at 4 - 8 years, and ranging in size from 32.5 -
              62.5 cm (12.8 - 24.6 inches) standard length (SL). In a Louisiana
              study, Sundararaj and Suttkus (1962) reported that Age III females
              contribute approximately 41% of all eggs spawned, and thus have
              the greatest reproductive potential of all age classes. Age IV females
              contributed 27% of the eggs spawned, while Age II females contributed
              24%. In an Everglades study, Rutherford et al. (1982) found that
              most male spawners were Ages II, III, and IV.</p>
            <p class="body"><b>Embryology:</b>
              Eggs are spherical, generally with a single oil droplet. Sometimes,
              however, more than one droplet is observed (Tabb 1966). Eggs can
              be both demersal and pelagic, depending on salinity conditions (Perret
              et al. 1980). When salinity is high, eggs are buoyant. When salinity
              drops below 25 parts per thousand (ppt), eggs tend to sink. Optimum
              survival salinity for eggs and larvae is approximately 28 ppt (Taniguchi
              1980). </font></p>
            <p class="body">Larvae hatch approximately 18 hours after
              fertilization and measure 1.3 - 1.6 mm (0.05 - 0.06 inches) SL under
              laboratory conditions (Fable et al. 1978). At 10 - 15 mm (0.4 -
              0.6 inches) in length, larvae are most commonly found in shallow
              seagrass beds in bays and lagoons. At water temperatures averaging
              28 &ordm;C (82.4 &ordm;F), larvae persist for 20 days before metamorphosis.
              Juveniles 6-8 weeks of age measure 2.5 - 5.0 cm (1.0 - 2.0 inches)
              in length and begin to form schools consisting of similarly sized
              individuals. Schooling behavior remains strong until approximately
              Age VI - VII, when both males and females become semi-solitary (Tabb
              1966).</p>
            <p class="body">In laboratory studies, spotted seatrout larvae
              held at 24-26&ordm;C (75.2 - 78.8 &ordm;F) grew from 1.5 mm (0.05
              inches) at hatching to 4.5 mm (0.18 inches) SL in 15days (Fable
              et al. 1980).</p>

   	<p class="heading">PHYSICAL TOLERANCES</p>
    <p class="title">Temperature</p>
              <p class="body">In Florida, spawning is strongly influenced by temperature and salinity.
              Tabb (1958) reported that spawning in south Florida begins when
              water temperatures near 25&ordm;C (77 &ordm;F), but stopped when
              water temperatures rose over 28 &ordm;C (82.4 &ordm;F). Data from
              the Everglades, reported by Jannke (1971), is in agreement, with
              large-scale spawning occurring when water temperature reached 24&ordm;C
              (75.2 &ordm;F), but becoming reduced when water temperatures were
              above 30 &ordm;C (86 &ordm;F).</p>
            <p class="body">Young spotted seatrout were collected from
              the west coast of Florida where water temperatures ranged from 12
              -29 &ordm;C (53.6 - 84.2 &ordm;F), while in the Everglades, young
              seatrout were collected in waters from 16 - 32 &ordm;C (60.8 - 89.6&ordm;F)
              (Jannke 1971). Tabb (1958) reported optimum temperatures for adult
              spotted seatrout as 15-27 &ordm;C (59 - 80.6 &ordm;F). Taniguchi
              (1980) reported optimum larval temperature ranges from 23-33 &ordm;C
              (73.4 - 91.4 &ordm;F) in south Florida.</p>
            <p class="body">Winter fish kills are rare for seatrout in
              Florida because seatrout readily migrate to deeper, more temperature-stable
              channels and offshore waters (Moody 1950; Tabb 1961). Mortality
              was reported by Tabb (1958) reported winter fish kills of seatrout
              when air temperatures in winter dropped to 7 &ordm;C (44.6 &ordm;F)
              for 12 hours or more. Seatrout that migrate to deeper-water channels
              and offshore waters to escape low water temperatures tend to remain
              in these waters for the rest of the winter (Tabb 1958).</p>
            <p class="body">Seatrout are also known to migrate in response
              to high water temperatures in hot summer months, with Mahood (1974)
              reporting that spotted seatrout seek out colder, deeper waters in
              the warmest summer months.</p>
            <p class="body"><b>Salinity:</b>
              Adults and juveniles have similar preferences for salinity (Johnson
              and Seaman 1986), but abrupt salinity changes have adverse effects
              of spotted seatrout (Tabb 1966). <em>Cynoscion nebulosus</em> is
              found in waters where salinity ranges from 0-37 parts per thousand
              (ppt) (Herald and Strickland 1949; Tabb 1966; Jannke 1971). Tabb
              (1966) reported that seatrout abundance peaks at salinities ranging
              from 15-35 ppt. Spawning generally peaks when salinity in the home
              estuary is high, typically 30 - 35 ppt (Johnson and Seaman 1986).

            <p class="body">In a Texas study, Wohlschlag and Wakeman (1978)
              reported optimum salinity for 17.4 - 43.5 cm (6.8 - 17.1 inches) fish
              was 20 ppt. Seatrout reportedly had difficulty maintaining swimming
              speed at salinities below 10 ppt, or above 45 ppt. Taniguchi (1982)
              reported 100% survival of eggs and larvae when salinity was 19-38
              ppt.</p>
            <p class="body">Higman (1967) noted a positive correlation
              between recreational catch of spotted seatrout with annual rainfall
              amounts in the previous 3 years.</p>
            <p class="body"><strong>Oxygen:</strong>
              Oxygen requirements are partially dependent on salinity and temperature
              conditions in the environment. At an optimum temperature of 28 &ordm;C
              (82.4 &ordm;F) and salinity of 20 ppt, Wohlschlag and Wakeman (1978)
              reported hourly oxygen consumption was 214 - 574 mg O<sub>2</sub>/kg body weight;
              but was 148 - 502 mg O<sub>2</sub>/kg body weight when temp was raised to 30
              &ordm;C. </font></p>
            <p class="body">In aquaculture ponds, larval spotted seatrout
              died when dissolved oxygen in Texas ponds dropped below 4 ppm (Colura
              et al. 1976).</p>

	<p class="title">Trophic Mode</p>
              <p class="body"><em>Cynoscion nebulosus</em> is among the top predators in many
              estuaries, and sometimes is the only large carnivore in an estuary
              (Tabb 1966). Small seatrout 20-50mm (0.8 - 2 inches) SL are planktivorous
              and feed primarily on copepods (Moody 1950; Tabb 1961; Adams et
              al. 1973; Rutherford et al. 1982; McMichael and Peters 1989). Larger
              seatrout, to 70 mm (2.8 inches) in length feed primarily on benthic
              invertebrates, especially mysids (Moody 1950, Darnell 1958; McMichael
              and Peters 1989). A dietary shift occurs once seatrout reach approximately
              40 - 150 mm (1.6 - 5.9 inches) and begin to feed more on penaeid
              shrimps and small fishes (Moody 1950; McMichael and Peters 1989).
              Indian River Lagoon seatrout were reported to consume shrimp in
              the summer and early winter, the most abundant period for shrimp;
              but switched to fish in late winter through spring (Tabb 1961).</p>
            <p class="body"><em>Cynoscion nebulosus</em> feed in midwater
              or near the surface, with major food species including anchovies,
              pinfish, silversides, mullet, croakers, menhaden, snapper, gobies,
              mojarras and silver trout (Moody 1950; Darnell 1958; Adams et al.
              1973; Rutherford et al. 1982).</p>
            <p class="title">Competitors</p>
              <p class="body">Probable competitors for both food and space, particularly in the
              early life history stages include other sciaenids, pinfish, menhaden,
              catfishes, anchovies and silversides. Various types of invertebrate
              larvae may also compete with larval seatrout for copepods and other
              zooplankton (Tabb 1961; Rutherford et al. 1982).</p>
            <p class="body">Adult seatrout are likely to compete with
              other shrimp-feeding and fish-feeding species such as sand trout,<em>
              Cynoscion arenarius</em>; redfish, <em>Sciaenops ocellatus</em>;
              flounders, <em>Paralicthyes</em> spp., catfishes, snook, <em>Centropomus</em>
              spp., snapper, jacks, and tarpon, <em>Megalops atlanitcus</em> (Johnson
              and Seaman 1986).</p>
	   <p class="title">Predators</p>
              <p class="body">Larger fishes are the major predators on <em>Cynoscion nebulosus</em>.
              Predatory birds, especially osprey, also impact seatrout populations.</p>

             <p class="title">Habitats</p>
             <p class="body"><em>Cynoscion nebulosus</em> are commonly found in shallow, vegetated,
              brackish and marine waters to a depth of approximately 10 m (32
              feet). They are often associated with seagrasses and saltmarshes
              adjacent to deeper channels that are used as refuges from temperature
              extremes (Moody 1950; Tabb 1958).</p>
            <p class="body">Larvae are most common in shallow seagrass
              beds in bays and lagoons during the summer months. Juveniles and
              pre-recruits measuring less than 355 mm (13.9 inches) TL associate
              with seagrasses, though some are found in channels and backwater
              areas as well (Tabb 1966; McMichael and Peters 1989). Adults occur
              in a wide variety of estuarine habitats including shallow seagrass
              beds, oyster reefs, over sand bottoms, deep holes, in mangrove creeks,
              and in areas having manmade structures such as docks and piers.</p>
            <p class="body">In Florida, spotted seatrout tend to spawn
              and live in particular estuaries, never migrating more than short
              distances (Johnson and Seaman 1986). Spawning habitat includes the
              non-tidal areas of estuaries and bays, deeper channels adjacent
              to seagrass beds, near tidal passes and also nearshore waters outside
              of estuaries (Pearson 1929; Tabb 1961; Tabb et al. 1962; Jannke
              1971).</p>
              <p class="title">Activity Time</p>

<p class="body">Spawning typically occurs at night with individuals in the school
              lightly bumping one another along the sides as males in the school
              produce croaking and grunting sounds by vibration of their swim
              bladders. Feeding occurs most actively in the early morning hours
              (Johnson and Seaman 1986).</p>

     <p class="title">Special Status</p>
            <p class="body">Commercial, recreational fishery species.</p>
            <p class="title">Fisheries Importance</p>
              <p class="body"><em>Cynoscion nebulosus</em> is a major commercial and game species throughout is range, but
              is especially important recreationally in Florida. Between
              1987 - 2001, the commercial harvest of <em>Cynoscion</em> <em>nebulosus</em>
              in Florida totaled 10.3 million pounds, and was valued at $12.3
              million. Approximately 74% of landings occurred on Florida's west
              coast, which accounted for 7.6 million pounds, with a dollar value
              of 8.6 million. East coast commercial landings accounted for approximately
              2.6 million pounds,which had a commercial vale of $3.6 million.
              The 5 county area encompassing the IRL (Volusia, Brevard, Indian
              River, St. Lucie and Martin Counties) accounted for 2.2 million
              pound of the commercial harvest, which had a value of $2.8 million.
              This ranks the spotted seatrout twentieth in commercial value to
              IRL counties, and twenty-fifth in pounds harvested.</p>
            <p class="body"> Figure 1 below shows the
              dollar value of the spotted seatrout commercial fishery to IRL counties
              by year. The fishery ranged in value from a high of $329,756 in
              1989, to a low of $44,961 in 2001. Indian River County accounted
              for 31.5% of the catch, followed by Volusia (28.9%), Brevard (27.7%),
              St. Lucie (15.7%) and Martin (1.2%) Counties.</p>
            <p class="body">Of note is the dramatic
              decrease in commercial catch after 1995, which coincides with the
              enactment of Florida's ban on gillnetting, and the subsequent switch
              to other gear types. Prior to 1995 most commercial landings of spotted
              seatrout were accomplished with gill nets. However, after the net
              ban, approximately 87% of the commercial catch between 1996-1998
              was accomplished with hook and line gear, while 7% was accomplished
              with cast nets (Murphy et al. 1999).</p>

            <p class="title">Recreational Fishery</p>
              <p class="body">Within the 5-county area of the Indian River Lagoon, spotted seatrout
              are highly prized gamefishes. Recreational anglers captured 1.5
              million spotted seatrout between 1997 - 2004 (Table 4, Figure 3),
              not counting those fishes that were caught and released. The bulk
              of the recreational catch (52.5%) was taken within the Indian River
              Lagoon. Approximately 42.5% of the recreational catch is harvested
              from other inland waters. Anglers fishing to 3 miles offshore accounted
              for 4.8% of the harvest, while those fishing up to 200 miles offshore
              accounted for only 0.2% of the total.</p>
            <p class="body">Statewide, recreational
              anglers harvest more spotted seatrout than do commercial enterprises.
              Prior to 1996, recreational landings in Florida accounted for approximately
              78% of statewide harvest (Murphy et al. 1999). This figure increased
              to 96% from 1996 - 1998 following the commercial gillnet ban. In
              the Atlantic coast region from Volusia county south, recreational
              anglers benefited greatly from the commercial gillnet ban. Prior
              to 1995, recreational anglers captured approximately 55 % of the
              total catch in central to southern Florida. Following the net ban,
              this figure rose to 84%, with commercial interests accounting for
              only 16% of the total.</p>
            <p class="body">Fishing regulations in Florida
              state that spotted seatrout must be at least 15 inches total length
              (TL), but not more than 20 inches TL to be of legal size; however,
              one seatrout larger than 20 inches TL may be kept per person per
              day. Seatrout season is closed from December 15 - January 31, and
              during the spawning season from June - August on the Atlantic coast,
              and from May-August on the Gulf coast. A bag limit of 4 legal-sized
              seatrout per person per day is in effect.</p>
