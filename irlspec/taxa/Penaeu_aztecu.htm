  <p class="title">Species Description</p>
<p class="body">The brown shrimp, <i>Penaeus aztecus</i>, is a species of grooved, burrowing
shrimp, common in Florida waters. Antennae are significantly longer than body
length. Its carapace has a medial carina on the anterior
surface that is bordered on either side by a broad, somewhat rounded groove. The
prominent rostrum is slightly upturned with 5-10 sharp teeth on the upper edge.
The integument is thin and translucent in appearance. Chromatophores give the
animal a brown to olive-green appearance, though both red and green specimens of
this species have been reported. The first 3 pairs of walking legs are chelate.
Uropods are rounded and generally colored reddish-brown in the distal portions.
The telson bears a sharp tip and a deep medial groove anteriorally.</p>
<p class="body">This species exhibits sexual dimorphism, with females growing larger than males. Generally, males attain only 3/5 of female weight, and 5/6 of female
length. Females are further distinguished by the presence of a closed thelycum located on the ventral sternum of the thorax, while males are identified by the presence of the pentasma.</p>

  	<p class="heading">HABITAT AND DISTRIBUTION</p>
    <p class="title">Regional Occurrence</p>
<p class="body">Brown shrimp occur along the Western Atlantic coast from approximately Martha's Vineyard, MA through Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the lower Yucatan Peninsula (Williams 1984).</p>

<p class="title">IRL Distribution</p>
<p class="body"><i>P. aztecus</i> occurs throughout the Indian River Lagoon.</p>
</li>
   <li>
   		<p class="heading">LIFE HISTORY AND POPULATION BIOLOGY</p>
      <p class="title">Age, Size, Lifespan</p>
<p class="body">Large specimens of <i>P. aztecus</i> males attain an adult size of
approximatley195 mm in length, while large female specimens may reach 236 mm in
length (Williams 1955). Growth rates for juvenile <i>P. aztecus</i> in North
Carolina were estimated by Williams (1955) to be 46 mm per month. In Louisiana,
Wilson (1969) estimated growth rates ranging from 45 - 50 mm per month, with
overall growth decreasing with age.</p>
<p class="body">Growth slows markedly when brown shrimp reach approximately 100 mm. Beyond
this size class, male growth slows in comparison to female growth.</p>

<p class="title">Abundance</p>
<p class="body"><i>P. aztecus</i> can be abundant throughout its range and commercial catch
rates for this species sometimes surpass those of other penaeids. The area around
the Bay of Campeche, TX is one area where this species is highly abundant.</p>

<p class="title">Locomotion</p>
<p class="body"><i>P. aztecus</i> is an active swimmer and burrower.</p>
<b>
<p class="title">Reproduction</p>
<p class="body"><i>P. aztecus</i> becomes reproductive after reaching a size of 140 mm (Renfro
1964). This species is known to have an extended spawning season that is likely
to vary in different geographic areas of its range. Gonads mature in August and
become opaque white, yellow or tan in color when fully ripe (Broad 1950; Brown
and Patlan 1974). Brown shrimp spawn offshore at depths that generally exceed 18
m (Larson et al. 1989)</p>
<p class="body">Data from Burkenroad (1939) showed that sex ratios of <i>P. aztecus</i>
change with water depth. In Louisiana waters, the sex ratio nearshore is
balanced at approximately 1:1. However, in deeper waters ranging from 90 - 130
m in depth, the sex ratio changes to 1:2 in favor of females. Impregnated
females in these waters occurred only beyond 18 m depth. This occurrence pattern
is suggestive that spawning sites for <i>P. aztecus</i> are likely to be further
offshore in deeper waters than occurs in other Penaeids such as <i>P. dourarum</i>
(pink shrimp) and <i>P. setiferus</i> (white shrimp).</p>

<p class="title">Embryology</p>
<p class="body">Eggs of <i>P. aztecus</i> are demersal and spherical, measuring approximately
0.26 - 0.28 mm in diameter (Pearson 1939 IN: Larson et al. 1989). Hatching
occurs with 24 hours. Larvae develop offshore through 5 naupliar, 3 protozoeal,
and 3 mysis stages before metamorphosing into postlarvae (Cook and Murphy 1969, 1971). Several postlarval stages occur prior to metamorphosis to the juvenile stage. Larval development takes approximately 11 days at a temperature of 32&deg;C, and approximately 17 days at a temperature of 24&deg;C (Cook and Murphy 1969).</p>
<p class="body">In studies of wild Penaid populations, <i>P. aztecus</i> larvae are most
commonly sampled below mid-depth. Protozoea of this species are likely to occur
nearest the bottom, while postlarval stages occur at, or slightly above
mid-depth. However, all stages ascend to surface waters with the onset of
darkness.</p>
<p class="body">Postlarvae return to coastlines on surface current during late winter and
spring (Bearden 1961). Recruitment studies in the Carolinas revealed that
postlarval <i>P. aztecus</i> began entering sounds in North Carolina from
October through May, with peak recruitment in March and April (Zamora and Trent
1968). In South Carolina, <i>P. aztecus</i> postlarvae are found in all months
of the year, with recruitment peaking during February and March (Bearden 1961).
Juveniles are collected beginning in mid-April and continuing throughout the
summer months (Williams 1955). In one Texas study, Copeland and Truitt (1966)
observed that spring recruitment peaks were greatest during evening flood tides.</p>
<p class="body">Young <i>P. aztecus</i> postlarvae enter estuaries on flood tides and migrate
to shallow, low-salinity waters. Growth is rapid during the warmer summer
months. As they grow, they begin migration into progressively more saline
waters, eventually returning to offshore areas.</p>
</li>
   <li>
   	<p class="heading">PHYSICAL TOLERANCES</p>
    <p class="title">Temperature</p>
<p class="body">Under laboratory conditions, larvae of <i>P. aztecus</i> did not complete
development when temperatures were sustained below 24 &deg;
C. Nauplii, protozoea and mysis stages survived at higher rates when held at
temperatures above 24 &deg; C (Cook and Murphy 1969).
The lethal maximum temperature for postlarval <i>P. aztecus</i> was 36.6 &deg;C.
Juveniles have been collected from waters at temperatures as high as 38 &deg;C,
though they experience physiological stress at temperatures as low as 10 &deg;C,
and at temperatures above 32 &deg;C (Larson et al.
1989).</p>
<p class="body">Burrowing has been studied as a behavioral response to low temperatures
(Aldrich et al. 1968). In laboratory studies, <i>P. aztecus</i> was observed to
burrow as temperatures fell below the 12 - 17 &deg; C
range, and re-emerge from sediments when temperatures rose above 18 - 21.5&deg;
C. A closely related penaeid, <i>P. setiferus</i> (white shrimp) showed no such
response to lower temperatures. It was hypothesized from this result that
burrowing would have more survival value to <i>P. aztecus</i> than other
congeners since <i>P. aztecus</i> is known to reach estuarine habitats earlier
in the year than its congeners. <i>P. setiferus</i>, for example, arrives at
coastal bays during the summer months.</p>

<p class="title">Salinity</p>
<p class="body">At salinities below 27 ppt. or above 35 ppt. hatching rates and larval survival
were diminished (Cook and Murphy 1969). In early laboratory studies of
postlarval growth rates vs. salinity, growth did not differ significantly when
salinity ranged between 5 - 40 ppt (Zein-Eldin 1963). However, when
temperature was added as a factor, larvae held at these same salinities did show
differences in growth rates. Postlarvae were able to survive for one month but
did not grow when held at a temperature of 11&deg;C at
salinity of 15 ppt or above. Larvae grew at temperatures between 11 - 25 &deg;C,
with markedly improved growth rates at the higher end of that range. Later
studies (i.e. Zein-Eldin and Griffith 1966) confirmed that optimal growth occurs
at temperatures between 22.5 - 30 &deg; C. The
osmoregulatory ability of <i>P. aztecus</i> is compromised in low temperatures,
with larvae showing decreased tolerance to low salinity water at temperatures
below 15&deg;C.</p>

<p class="body">At salinities under 2 ppt. Venkatamariah et al. (1972) observed
disorientation and convulsive movements in brown shrimp, though other
investigators have collected brown shrimp in waters where salinity was as low as
0.2 ppt. Williams (1960) observed that at the high end of the salinity scale,
brown shrimp are able to continue osmoregulation even at salinity as high as 69
ppt.</p>

<p class="title">Dissolved Oxygen</p>
<p class="body">Minello and Zimmerman (1989) found that brown shrimp can both detect and
avoid hypoxic conditions. Juveniles ranging in length from 36 - 38 mm attempt avoidance when dissolved oxygen (D.O.) levels approach 1.5 - 2 ppm D.O. Lethal dissolved oxygen levels for juveniles occurs at approximately 0.8 ppm D.O.</p>

<p class="title">Parasitic Infestations and Diseases</p>
<p class="body">Bacterial infections of brown shrimp are predominantly <i>Vibrio, Aeromonas</i>,
and <i>Pseudomonas</i>. Ciliates and sporozoan protists, as well as larval
nematodes and cestodes may also infest <i>P. aztecus</i> (Larson et al. 1989).
Minello and Zimmerman (1989) suggested that bacterial infection and parasites do
not cause direct mortality, but rather, reduce vigor and increase predation
rates on brown shrimp.</p>
</li>
   <li>
   	<p class="heading">COMMUNITY ECOLOGY</p>
	<p class="title">Trophic Mode</p>
<p class="body"><i>P. aztecus</i>, like other penaeids, is an opportunistic omnivore that consumes
some algal species (i.e., filamentous green algae, benthic diatoms, plant
detritus, etc.) as well as small invertebrates such as copepods, mollusks, and
annelids (Dall 1968; Odum and Heald 1972).</p>
<p class="body">Jones (1973), in a Louisiana study, found a dietary shift in <i>P. aztecus</i>
as body size increased. Small shrimp measuring 22 - 44 mm in length were
observed to feed nonselectively on top-layer sediments. Shrimp in a larger size
class, from 45 - 64 mm in length, became selective in their feeding,
preferring only organic materials from top-layer sediments. Larger shrimp, from
65 - 100 mm in length became predatory, feeding on annelid worms, amphipods,
zooplankton larvae, and nematodes.</p>

<p class="title">Competitors</p>
<p class="body"><i>P. aztecus</i> is likely to compete with other crustacean species, as well as
with some fishes for access to invertebrate prey.</p>

<p class="title">Habitats</p>
<p class="body">Brown shrimp are commonly found in estuaries and littoral zones along coasts.
Primary habitats for these shrimp are muddy bottom areas from the intertidal
zone to approximately 110 m. The greatest density of <i>P. aztecus</i> occurs at
depths between 27 - 55 m. This species is rarely observed at depths exceeding
165 m (Williams 1984).</p>
<p class="body">In laboratory studies of substrate preference (Williams 1958), <i>P. aztecus</i> favored sandy mud and loose peat substrates over other offerings such as loose sand, and shell sand.</p>

<p class="title">Activity Time</p>
<p class="body"><i>P. aztecus</i> is a burrowing shrimp that is considerably more active at
night in open waters than it is during the daylight hours (Williams 1984).</p>

     <p class="title">Special Status</p>
<p class="body">Commercially important</p>

<p class="title">Fisheries Importance</p>
<p class="body">The brown shrimp is a highly valued commercial fishery species both within Florida and
nationally. The statewide commercial catch of<i> </i>brown shrimp, <i>Penaeus
aztecus</i>, between the years 1987 - 2001 was 31.5 million pounds, with a
dollar value of over $71.1 million. Within the 5 county area encompassing
the IRL (Volusia, Brevard, Indian River, St. Lucie and Martin Counties) the
commercial catch of brown shrimp
accounts for approximately 16% of the statewide total, with a harvest of 4.6
million pounds, and a value of over $11.6 million.  This
ranks the brown shrimp tenth in commercial value within the IRL, and sixteenth in
pounds harvested.</p>
<p class="body">Figure 1 and Table 1 below show the dollar value of the
brown shrimp fishery to IRL counties by year. As shown, commercial catch ranged from a
low of $65,978  in 1988 to a high of over $1.9 million  in 1996. Brevard
County accounted for the bulk of the commercial catch in most years, with 58% of
the total brown shrimp harvest in the IRL area. Volusia County ranked
second, with 32% of the harvest.  St. Lucie County reported
commercial harvests for brown shrimp in only 5 years, from 1993 - 1998, yet
accounted for 10% of the total catch. Commercial catches for brown shrimp
were not reported from either Indian River or Martin Counties.</p>

<p class="title">Benefit in IRL</p>
<p class="body">Brown shrimp are commercially important in Florida. Fisheries data from 1996
shows brown shrimp catches in Brevard County, Indian River County and Martin
County of approximately 906,900 pounds of the state-wide catch (data provided by
Florida Department of Environmental Protection). Two other counties, St. Lucie
and Volusia did not report commercial harvests of brown shrimp. In these
counties, rock shrimp made up the bulk of commercial harvesting efforts.</p>
<p class="body">Statistics from the National Marine Fisheries Service show that state-wide in
Florida during 1998, 250 metric tons of brown shrimp were harvested, with a
value of $1,475,059. In 1999, state-wide captures of brown shrimp were 395
metric tons, at a value of $2,163,466.</p>

<p class="title">Economic Importance</p>
<p class="body"><i>P. aztecus</i> is extensively targeted as a commercial species throughout
much of its range. Annual catch statistics for this species often exceeds those
for other penaeid species especially in the Gulf of Mexico near the Bay of
Campeche, TX.</p>
<p class="body">The National Marine Fisheries Service reported commercial catches nation-wide
for brown shrimp in1998 were 59,118.8 metric tons, with a commercial value of
$222,957,225 dollars. For 1999, the commercial catch was 62,197.7 metric tons,
with a value of $250,733,691 dollars.</p>
