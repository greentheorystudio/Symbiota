                  <br>
                  <font color="000080">The Atlantic sand fiddler, <em>Uca pugilator</em>,
                  is one of approximately 97 species belonging to the family Ocypodidae
                  (Rosenberg 2001). Members of this family are characterized by
                  a thick, squarish body and herding behavior (Ruppert &amp; Fox
                  1988). Male crabs also bear one greatly enlarged pincer, either
                  right or left, for combat and mating rituals; whereas, the claws
                  of females are roughly equal in size. Fiddler crabs share many
                  common morphological characteristics and behaviors, but identification
                  of species is usually easily achieved through examination of
                  body color and claw structure. Body color of the Atlantic sand
                  fiddler is mostly white to yellowish white, becoming paler during
                  courtship (Crane 1975). Displaying males have a characteristic
                  pink or purple patch on the middle of the carapace, which is
                  often mottled brown in non-displaying males. The major cheliped
                  (appendage bearing the major claw) of the male is yellowish
                  white, often with pale orange at the base of the claw. The minor
                  claw is white, and the eyestalks are buff to grayish white,
                  never green like some similar species. Many tubercles or bumps
                  cover the outer surfaces of the claw. However, the oblique ridge
                  of tubercles common in several fiddler crab species is absent
                  in <em>U. pugilator</em>. </font></p>

                  small, with a carapace length of about 1.2 cm (Kaplan 1988).
                  The body is dark mottled brown, with red or pink on the carapace
                  and red on the major claw. Walking legs are usually brown or
                  striped with gray, and the palm of the major claw bears large
                  tubercles. Most populations of <em>U. burgersi</em> are found
                  in mud or muddy sand around mangroves or near the mouths of
                  streams from eastern Florida to South America.</font></p>

                  is large, with a carapace width reaching 2.3 cm (Kaplan 1988).
                  It is aptly named for the red bands present on the joints of
                  the appendages. The large claw bears many tubercles, which diminish
                  to granules toward the bottom, and the upper finger (movable
                  top part of the closable claw) curves down below the tip of
                  the lower (Kaplan 1988). This species prefers muddy sediments
                  around <em>Spartina</em> marshes, from brackish to nearly freshwater,
                  in Massachusetts to northern Florida and Louisiana.</font></p>

                  <em>U. pugnax</em>, has a carapace approximately 1.2 cm long
                  (Kaplan 1988). The body is usually brown or yellowish with a
                  row of tubercles on the palm of the major claw (Ruppert &amp;
                  Fox 1988). This species is most abundant in muddy areas of salt
                  marshes from Massachusetts to eastern Florida (Kaplan 1988).</font></p>
                <p><font color="000080">The carapace of the <strong>mudflat fiddler</strong>,
                  <em>U. rapax</em>, is about 2.1 cm long and light tan in color
                  (Kaplan 1988). The color of the major claw is similar, with
                  a darker lower palm and finger. The center of the palm is almost
                  smooth, but still bears small granules. This species inhabits
                  mud banks near mangroves and mouths of streams from Florida
                  to South America. Crane (1975) defines the Daytona Beach area
                  on the east coast of Florida as the northern limit for <em>U
                  rapax</em>. The subspecies <em>U. rapax rapax</em> is very similar
                  in appearance (see Crane 1975 for diagnostic characteristics).

                <p><font color="000080">The <strong>longfinger fiddler</strong>,
                  <em>U. speciosa</em>, has a small carapace length of about 1.1
                  cm (Kaplan 1988). Its color is seasonally variable, but usually
                  remains darker than the characteristic brilliant white of the
                  major claw. The palm bears a slightly curved row of large tubercles.
                  These crabs inhabit muddy areas, mostly around mangroves from
                  Florida to Cuba.</font></p>

                  <em>U. thayeri</em>, has a carapace measuring about 1.9 cm in
                  length (Kaplan 1988). The carapace and major claw are both brown
                  to orange-brown (Crane 1975, Kaplan 1988), and both fingers
                  of the claw are bent down (Ruppert &amp; Fox 1988). This species
                  is found on mud banks of estuaries and streams near mangroves,
                  from Florida to South America. Females often build tall mud
                  chimneys at the entrance to their burrows during breeding season
                  (Crane 1975, Kaplan 1988).</font></p>

                  1975). The Atlantic sand fiddler is found on muddy to sandy
                  soils, but is usually more prominent in sandier areas containing
                  scattered shells and stones (Crane 1975). Individuals also occupy
                  areas around mangroves and in salt marshes, among stands of
                  the cordgrass, <em>Spartina alterniflora</em> (Brodie <em>et

                  width, respectively (Crane 1975). The major claw in males is
                  much larger than the body, with a maximum length of 4.1 cm (Gosner
                  1978) and up to 3.5 cm in most specimens collected in the field
                  (Crane 1975). Little information is reported for the maximum
                  age and average lifespan of <em>U. pugilator</em>. However,
                  the lifespan in a similar species, <em>U. rapax</em>, is only
                  about 1.4 years (Koch <em>et al.</em> 2005).</font><br>

                  <font color="000080">Although fiddler crabs are territorial,
                  the species is quite social and lives in large groups. When
                  <em>U. pugilator</em> was first described by Louis Bosc in 1802,
                  he observed that "thousands or even millions" Covered the beaches
                  of the Carolinas (Crane 1975). Today, those numbers have declined
                  as a result of pollution and habitat degradation, but relatively
                  large populations can still be found. Little information exists
                  for abundance estimates of <em>U. pugilator</em> in the IRL,
                  but field densities in South Carolina populations have reached
                  up to 75 m<sup>-2</sup> (Pratt &amp; McLain 2006). Studies on
                  fiddlers in North Carolina revealed that females are more abundant
                  than males (Colby &amp; Fonseca 1984), a pattern that likely
                  exists for populations in other locations based on courtship
                  and mating behaviors (see below).</font></p>
                <p><font color="008080"><strong>Molting &amp; Limb Regeneration:</strong></font><br>
                  <font color="000080">Like other arthropods, fiddler crabs must
                  molt in order to grow larger. This process, known as "ecdysis",
                  occurs most frequently in fast-growing juveniles and slows during
                  adulthood. During ecdysis, the hard exoskeleton is shed in one
                  piece, exposing the new, soft underlying skeleton. Water is
                  pumped into the body to expand the size of the new exoskeleton
                  before it hardens (<em>eg.</em> Guyselman 1953). Molting is
                  not only used for growth, but also to regenerate missing limbs.
                  During combat or to escape from predators, fiddler crabs autotomize
                  or cast off limbs at a predetermined point (Weis 1977), usually
                  at the base of all walking legs (Hopkins 2001). New limbs grow
                  in a folded position within a layer of the cuticle, unfolding
                  and expanding during the molting process. Ecdysis is triggered
                  and accelerated by multiple autonomy and removal of the eyestalks
                  (Abramowitz &amp; Abramowitz 1940, Hopkins 1982). Molting under
                  these circumctances may not result in growth, and the overall
                  size of the crab may even decrease as energy is used to regenerate
                  several missing limbs (Hopkins 1982). A single molt in some
                  individuals is often enough to completely regenerate a missing
                  limb (Hopkins 2001), but other crabs may require several molts
                  before an appendage is restored to its original size. Several
                  factors affect the frequency and success of molting and limb
                  regeneration, including food availability, temperature and pollution.
                  For example, the presence of methylmercury in polluted waters
                  can partially or fully inhibit regeneration of limbs in both
                  temperate and tropical fiddler crabs (Weis 1977). <br>

                  <font color="000080">Fiddler crabs are social organisms that
                  engage in elaborate mating displays before copulation. Males
                  use their large claw to attract mates through a series of waving
                  motions and acoustic drumming, also used to ward off potential
                  competitors. Waving displays are often characteristic of a certain
                  species, but usually occur at the mouth of the burrow in all
                  crabs. In <em>U. pugilator</em>, the large claw makes a loop
                  as it is brought up, pausing slightly before moving to the side
                  and down in front of the crab (Crane 1975). The carapace rises
                  with each wave and the small claw makes a roughly corresponding
                  motion. In high intensity displays, a series of 4 to 5 waves
                  is completed before the claw is lowered to its resting position.
                  Often, acoustic drumming and other sounds are produced by the
                  claws and legs to attract females (Crane 1975). Atlantic fiddler
                  crabs court and mate both during the day and at night. In daylight,
                  waving displays by males are likely most important; whereas,
                  acoustic signals predominate during nocturnal courtship. Once
                  the male has attracted a mate, she usually follows him into
                  the burrow for copulation, and it has been suggested that underground
                  mating in <em>U. pugilator</em> results in more viable eggs
                  (Salmon 1987). The resulting fertilized eggs are carried in
                  a clump, often called a sponge, on the abdomen of the female
                  until hatching. Ovigerous, or egg-bearing, females were seen
                  from May through August in North Carolina populations, most
                  measuring over 1.0 cm in carapace length (Colby &amp; Fonseca
                  1984).<br>

                  <font color="000080">Females release larvae into the water column
                  once they are fully developed, usually during large nocturnal
                  ebb tides (<em>eg.</em> Christy 1989). The purpose of this behavior
                  is most likely to transport larvae offshore, away from abundant
                  estuarine predators. Planktonic larvae develop through a series
                  of five zoeal stages (Christy 1989), feeding mostly on smaller
                  zooplankton. The final larval stage (postlarva) is the demersal,
                  or bottom-associated, megalopa. As the larvae travel back toward
                  the estuary, they metamorphose into megalopae and look for settlement
                  cues such as the presence of other members of the same species
                  (conspecifics) and the appropriate sediment type, before settling
                  to the bottom and undergoing their final metamorphosis to a
                  juvenile crab (<em>eg.</em> O'Connor 1993). Studies have shown
                  that <em>U. pugilator</em> megalopae have the ability to delay
                  metamorphosis for a limited time until a suitable habitat is
                  found (Christy 1989, O'Connor 1991).</font></p>

                  <font color="000080">The Atlantic sand fiddler is one of only
                  a few species that have large populations extending into temperate
                  zones (Crane 1975). Because of this expanded range, <em>U. pugilator</em>
                  is well adapted to subfreezing temperatures, regularly hibernating
                  in their burrows during cold weather. These crabs are also adapted
                  to warmer temperatures and high light levels, changing color
                  presumably as a thermoregulatory mechanism (Silbiger &amp; Munguia
                  2008, Wilkens &amp; Fingerman 1965). In as little as five minutes
                  after sun exposure (Silbiger &amp; Munguia 2008), crabs can
                  become pale, reflecting more light rays and remaining an average
                  of 2&deg;C cooler than dark crabs (Wilkens &amp; Fingerman
                  1965). The upper thermal tolerances for <em>U. pugilator</em>
                  vary with humidity, at approximately 42&deg;C and 46&deg;C
                  for saturated and dry air, respectively. The discrepancy between
                  these temperatures is likely the result of higher transpiration
                  rates for crabs in dry air helping to maintain a cooler core
                  body temperature (Wilkens &amp; Fingerman 1965).</font><br>

                  <font color="000080">The Atlantic sand fiddler is most common
                  in higher salinity environments. However, this species can tolerate
                  a wide range of salinities. In high salinity waters, it is considered
                  a better hyporegulator than many other <em>Uca</em> species
                  (Green <em>et al.</em> 1959, Thurman 2005). This ability enables
                  crabs to maintain a more constant salt concentration in their
                  body fluids, even when exposed to air (Thurman 2003). In field
                  studies, <em>U. pugilator</em> has been found in waters ranging
                  from 0.2 to 36.2 ppt (Godley &amp; Brodie 2007, Thurman 2005).

                  <font color="008080"><strong>Burrowing Behavior:</strong></font><br>
                  <font color="000080">Fiddler crabs are known for digging burrows
                  in muddy and/or sandy sediments of sheltered estuarine habitats.
                  These tunnels are used for mating, to escape extreme temperatures
                  and flooding, and as a refuge from predators. The burrows are
                  generally located in the intertidal zone, have only one opening
                  and are usually L-shaped (Ruppert &amp; Barnes 1994). The depth
                  of burrows can be as much as 60 cm (Gosner 1978), but most North
                  American species dig no deeper than 36 cm (Ruppert &amp; Barnes
                  1994). As the crab excavates the burrow during low tide, it
                  transports sediment to the surface by carrying it in the legs
                  of one side, rolling it into small balls and forming a pile
                  at the entrance of the hole (Ruppert &amp; Barnes 1994). When
                  the tide comes in, most crabs retreat into their burrows, placing
                  a sediment plug at the entrance to keep water from inundating
                  the tunnel. Burrowing behavior differs somewhat according to
                  species. In <em>U. pugilator</em>, the male excavates and defends
                  the burrow, especially during the breeding season (Pratt &amp;
                  McLain 2006). </font></p>
                <p><strong><font color="008080">Territoriality: </font></strong><br>
                  <font color="000080">Male fiddler crabs use their enlarged claw
                  not only to attract females, but also in territory disputes
                  with other crabs (Pratt &amp; McLain 2006, Ruppert &amp; Barnes
                  1994, Ruppert &amp; Fox 1988). Individual territories are located
                  around a single, centralized burrow. The areas are likely dependent
                  on crab density and species, but have been measured at about
                  100 cm<sup>2</sup> for <em>U. pugilator</em> (Pratt &amp; McLain
                  2006). Combat among males of this species ranges from no contact
                  to use of the major claw to push, grip or flip the opponent
                  (Pratt &amp; McLain 2006). Territoriality varies, and males
                  are most aggressive toward intruders attempting burrow take-overs
                  and similarly-sized male neighbors that may threaten mating
                  success.</font></p>
                <p><font color="008080"><strong>Trophic Mode:</strong></font><br>
                  <font color="000080">Although they are occasionally cannibalistic,
                  the majority of the fiddler crab diet consists of detritus,
                  bacteria and algae on and in the sediments (Gosner 1978). The
                  small claws transfer sediment to the mouthparts, where food
                  is separated from sand and other unwanted particles. Food is
                  swallowed and the mouthparts roll the remaining sand into tiny
                  balls that are placed back on the ground. These balls are much
                  smaller than those created during the excavation of burrows
                  (Ruppert &amp; Fox 1988). Mouthparts in many fiddlers are specialized
                  for a specific size range of sediment particles, and this adaptation
                  is partly responsible for the habitat and distribution of species.
                  Crabs also wander while feeding and some species move as far
                  as 50 m away from their burrows (Ruppert &amp; Fox 1988). </font><br>

                  <font color="000080">Predators of fiddler crabs include birds,
                  fishes, turtles, and mammals such as otters and raccoons (Colby
                  &amp; Fonseca 1984, Crane 1975, Ruppert &amp; Fox 1988), in
                  addition to being occasionally cannibalized by other fiddlers
                  (Gosner 1978). Crabs reduce predation risk by fleeing into their
                  burrows, and some studies speculate that <em>U. pugilator</em>
                  changes to a sandy color in part to camouflage its carapace
                  from predators (Dawkins 1971). Larvae of <em>Uca</em> spp. are
                  preyed upon by a variety of pelagic and benthic organisms, and
                  are cannibalized by adult fiddler crabs in captive populations
                  (O'Connor 1990).</font><br>

                  <font color="000080">Many species of fungi are obligate associates
                  of arthropod hosts (Mattson 1988). A fungus belonging to the
                  genus <em>Enterobryus</em> has been discovered in the hindgut
                  of <em>U. pugilator</em>. The fungus is not parasitic (Hibbits
                  1978, Lichtwardt 1976), and it has been suggested that the species
                  may even provide necessary chemical compounds, such as amino
                  acids, to the crab (Williams &amp; Lichtwardt 1972). In addition
                  to obligate associations, Atlantic fiddler crabs are found alongside
                  several organisms common to mangroves and salt marshes. For

                  not only to create territorial burrows, but also to bring organic
                  matter to the surface, stimulating microbial growth. Burrowing
                  activity often increases when food is limited to create a more
                  abundant nutrient source, but also results in the stimulated
                  growth of nearby mangroves and <em>Spartina</em> plants (Genoni
                  1985, 1991) through increased soil aeration and more nutrient
