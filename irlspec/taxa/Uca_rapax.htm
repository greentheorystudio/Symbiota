                  <br>
                  <font color="000080">The mudflat fiddler, <em>Uca rapax</em>,
                  is one of approximately 97 species belonging to the family Ocypodidae
                  (Rosenberg 2001). Members of this family are characterized by
                  a thick, squarish body and herding behavior (Ruppert &amp; Fox
                  1988). Male crabs also bear one greatly enlarged pincer, either
                  right or left, for combat and mating rituals; whereas, the claws
                  of females are roughly equal in size. Fiddler crabs share many
                  common morphological characteristics and behaviors, but identification
                  of species is usually easily achieved through examination of
                  body color and claw structure. The carapace of <em>U. rapax</em>
                  is narrow between the eyes, and light tan (Kaplan 1988) or occasionally
                  greenish blue in color (Crane 1975, Ruppert &amp; Fox 1988).
                  Eyestalks and the tips of the major claw in some specimens are
                  also green to blue (Crane 1975). However, the claw in most individuals
                  is gray to greenish yellow, sometimes with hints of orange and
                  white finger tips. The center of the palm is almost smooth,
                  but still bears small granules. Whitening of the carapace common
                  to displaying males in other <em>Uca</em> species is poorly
                  developed in <em>U. rapax</em>, and females are similar in color
                  to the less brilliant males.</font></p>

                  <font color="000080">The <strong>Atlantic sand fiddler</strong>
                  is mostly white to yellowish white, becoming paler during courtship
                  (Crane 1975). Displaying males have a characteristic pink or
                  purple patch on the middle of the carapace, which is often mottled
                  brown in non-displaying males. The major cheliped (appendage
                  bearing the major claw) of the male is yellowish white, often
                  with pale orange at the base of the claw. The minor claw is
                  white, and the eyestalks are buff to grayish white, never green.
                  Many tubercles or bumps cover the outer surfaces of the claw.
                  However, the oblique ridge of tubercles common in several fiddler
                  crab species is absent in <em>U. pugilator</em>. Most populations
                  of <em>U. pugilator</em> inhabit sandy shores from Massachusetts
                  to Florida (Kaplan 1988), the Gulf of Mexico from Florida to
                  Texas, and the Bahamas (Crane 1975).</font></p>
                <p><font color="000080">The <strong>saltpan fiddler</strong> is
                  small, with a carapace length of about 1.2 cm (Kaplan 1988).
                  The body is dark mottled brown, with red or pink on the carapace
                  and red on the major claw. Walking legs are usually brown or
                  striped with gray, and the palm of the major claw bears large
                  tubercles. Most populations of <em>U. burgersi</em> are found
                  in mud or muddy sand around mangroves or near the mouths of
                  streams from eastern Florida to South America.</font></p>
                <p><font color="000080">The <strong>redjointed fiddler</strong>
                  is large, with a carapace width reaching 2.3 cm (Kaplan 1988).
                  It is aptly named for the red bands present on the joints of
                  the appendages. The large claw bears many tubercles, which diminish
                  to granules toward the bottom, and the upper finger curves down
                  below the tip of the lower (Kaplan 1988). This species prefers
                  muddy sediments around <em>Spartina</em> marshes, from brackish
                  to nearly freshwater, in Massachusetts to northern Florida and
                  Louisiana.</font></p>
                <p><font color="000080">The <strong>Atlantic marsh fiddler</strong>,
                  <em>U. pugnax</em>, has a carapace approximately 1.2 cm long
                  (Kaplan 1988). The body is usually brown or yellowish with a
                  row of tubercles on the palm of the major claw (Ruppert &amp;
                  Fox 1988). This species is most abundant in muddy areas of salt
                  marshes from Massachusetts to eastern Florida (Kaplan 1988).</font></p>
                <p><font color="000080">The <strong>longfinger fiddler</strong>,
                  <em>U. speciosa</em>, has a small carapace length of about 1.1
                  cm (Kaplan 1988). Its color is seasonally variable, but usually
                  remains darker than the characteristic brilliant white of the
                  major claw. The palm bears a slightly curved row of large tubercles.
                  These crabs inhabit muddy areas, mostly around mangroves from
                  Florida to Cuba.</font></p>
                <p><font color="000080">The <strong>Atlantic mangrove fiddler</strong>,
                  <em>U. thayeri</em>, has a carapace measuring about 1.9 cm in
                  length (Kaplan 1988). The carapace and major claw are both brown
                  to orange-brown (Crane 1975, Kaplan 1988), and both fingers
                  of the claw are bent down (Ruppert &amp; Fox 1988). This species
                  is found on mud banks of estuaries and streams near mangroves,
                  from Florida to South America. Females often build tall mud
                  chimneys at the entrance to their burrows during breeding season
                  (Crane 1975, Kaplan 1988).</font></p>
                <p><font color="000080">The subspecies U. rapax rapax is very
                  similar in appearance to the mudflat fiddler (see Crane 1975

                  <font color="000080">The mudflat fiddler is found in warm temperate
                  to tropical coasts of the Gulf of Mexico and the western Atlantic
                  Ocean from the Daytona Beach area on the east coast of Florida
                  to S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil (Crane 1975). Most populations inhabit
                  mud or muddy sand banks around mangroves, river deltas, and
                  near the mouths of streams and rivers. In some Brazilian mangrove
                  forests, <em>U. rapax</em> is restricted to the high intertidal
                  zone (Koch <em>et al.</em> 2005), and is most commonly found
                  in medium-grained sand (Bezerra <em>et al.</em> 2006). </font><br>

                  <font color="000080">The maximum length of the carapace in <em>U.
                  rapax</em> is about 2.1 cm (Crane 1975, Kaplan 1988), although
                  most specimens collected are between 7 and 18 cm (Koch <em>et
                  al.</em> 2005). The major claw in male fiddlers is must larger
                  than the carapace, with a maximum length of 6.3 cm (Crane 1975).
                  As in other <em>Uca</em> species, the lifespan of the mudflat
                  fiddler is relatively short, lasting only about 1.4 years (Koch
                  <em>et al.</em> 2005).</font><br>

                  <font color="000080">Although fiddler crabs are territorial,
                  the species is quite social and lives in large groups. Abundance
                  estimates are limited to <em>U. rapax</em> in the IRL, but populations
                  in some Brazilian mangrove forests reach about 20 individuals
                  per square meter (Koch <em>et al.</em> 2005).</font></p>
                <p><font color="008080"><strong>Molting &amp; Limb Regeneration:</strong></font><br>
                  <font color="000080">Like other arthropods, fiddler crabs must
                  molt in order to grow larger. This process, known as "ecdysis",
                  occurs most frequently in fast-growing juveniles and slows during
                  adulthood (da Silva Castiglioni <em>et al.</em> 2007). During
                  ecdysis, the hard exoskeleton is shed in one piece, exposing
                  the new, soft underlying skeleton. Water is pumped into the
                  body to expand the size of the new exoskeleton before it hardens
                  (<em>eg.</em> Guyselman 1953). Molting is not only used for
                  growth, but also to regenerate missing limbs. During combat
                  or to escape predators, fiddler crabs autotomize or cast off
                  limbs at a predetermined point (Weis 1977), usually at the base
                  of all walking legs (Hopkins 2001). New limbs grow in a folded
                  position within a layer of the cuticle, unfolding and expanding
                  during the molting process. Ecdysis is triggered and accelerated
                  by multiple autonomy and removal of the eyestalks (Abramowitz
                  &amp; Abramowitz 1940, Hopkins 1982). Molting under these circumstances
                  may not result in growth, and the overall size of the crab may
                  even decrease as energy is used to regenerate several missing
                  limbs (Hopkins 1982). A single molt in some individuals is often
                  enough to completely regenerate a missing limb (Hopkins 2001),
                  but other crabs may require several molts before an appendage
                  is restored to its original size. Several factors affect the
                  frequency and success of molting and limb regeneration, including
                  food availability, temperature and pollution. For example, the
                  presence of methylmercury in polluted waters can partially or
                  fully inhibit regeneration of limbs in both temperate and tropical
                  fiddler crabs (Weis 1977). When compared to <em>U. pugilator</em>
                  and <em>U. thayeri</em>, the mudflat fiddler regenerated limbs
                  and hardened its carapace more quickly after ecdysis when inhabiting
                  waters with heavy metal pollutants. <br>

                  <font color="000080">Fiddler crabs are social organisms that
                  engage in elaborate mating displays before copulation. Males
                  use their large claw to attract mates through a series of waving
                  motions and acoustic drumming, also used to ward off potential
                  competitors. Waving displays are often characteristic of a certain
                  species, but usually occur at the mouth of the burrow in all
                  crabs. In <em>U. rapax</em>, the large claw creates a weak circular,
                  almost lateral movement, with a distinctive slow progression
                  and jerking motion (Crane 1975). Jerking is always present,
                  and the number of moves ranges from 8 to over 30, creating display
                  series lasting up to 13 seconds each. Often, acoustic drumming
                  and other sounds are produced by the claws and legs to attract
                  females (Crane 1975). Mudflat fiddler crabs court and mate both
                  during the day and at night. In daylight, waving displays by
                  males are likely most important; whereas, acoustic signals predominate
                  during nocturnal courtship. Once the male has attracted a mate,
                  she usually follows him into the burrow for copulation, and
                  few to no reports of aboveground mating have been documented
                  for in <em>U. rapax</em> (Crane 1975). The resulting fertilized
                  eggs are carried in a clump, often called a sponge, on the abdomen
                  of the female until hatching. Ovigerous, or egg-bearing, females
                  were seen throughout the warmer months in Brazilian populations
                  (da Silva Castiglioni <em>et al.</em> 2007), and individuals
                  were considered mature at carapace widths of about 1.4 and 1.2
                  cm for males and females, respectively (da Silva Castiglioni
                  &amp; Negreiros-Fransozo 2006).<br>

                  <font color="008080"><strong>Embryology:</strong></font><br>
                  <font color="000080">Female mudflat fiddlers can carry 5,000
                  to 30,000 eggs at one time, each with a volume of about 0.01
                  mm<sup>3</sup> (Figueiredo <em>et al.</em> 2008, Greenspan 1980).
                  Crabs release larvae into the water column once they are fully
                  developed, usually during large nocturnal ebb tides (<em>eg.</em>
                  Christy 1989). Unlike some other crabs, studies on <em>U. rapax</em>
                  in Panama found that the species only released larvae at night
                  (Morgan &amp; Christy 1994). The purpose of this behavior is
                  most likely to transport larvae offshore, away from abundant
                  estuarine predators, while reducing predation risk under low
                  light conditions. Planktonic larvae develop through a series
                  of five zoeal stages (Christy 1989), feeding mostly on smaller
                  zooplankton. The final larval stage (postlarva) is the demersal,
                  or bottom-associated, megalopa. As the larvae travel back toward
                  the estuary, they metamorphose into megalopae and look for settlement
                  cues such as the presence of other members of the same species
                  (conspecifics) and the appropriate sediment type, before settling
                  to the bottom and undergoing their final metamorphosis to a
                  juvenile crab (<em>eg.</em> O'Connor 1993). </font></p>

                  <font color="008080"><strong>Burrowing Behavior:</strong></font><br>
                  <font color="000080">Fiddler crabs are known for digging burrows
                  in muddy and/or sandy sediments of sheltered estuarine habitats.
                  These tunnels are used for mating, to escape extreme temperatures
                  and flooding, and as a refuge from predators. The burrows are
                  generally located in the intertidal zone, have only one opening
                  and are usually L-shaped (Ruppert &amp; Barnes 1994). The depth
                  of burrows can be as much as 60 cm (Gosner 1978), but most North
                  American species dig no deeper than 36 cm (Ruppert &amp; Barnes
                  1994). As the crab excavates the burrow during low tide, it
                  transports sediment to the surface by carrying it in the legs
                  of one side, rolling it into small balls and forming a pile
                  at the entrance of the hole (Ruppert &amp; Barnes 1994). When
                  the tide comes in, most crabs retreat into their burrows, placing
                  a sediment plug at the entrance to keep water from inundating
                  the tunnel. Burrowing behavior differs somewhat according to
                  species. In <em>U. rapax</em>, the male excavates and defends
                  the burrow, especially during the breeding season (Pratt &amp;
                  McLain 2006). Burrows of some populations of mudflat fiddlers
                  are most prevalent in the high intertidal zone (Koch <em>et
                  al.</em> 2005).</font></p>
                <p><strong><font color="008080">Territoriality: </font></strong><br>
                  <font color="000080">Male fiddler crabs use their enlarged claw
                  not only to attract females, but also in territory disputes
                  with other crabs (Pratt &amp; McLain 2006, Ruppert &amp; Barnes
                  1994, Ruppert &amp; Fox 1988). Individual territories are located
                  around a single, centralized burrow. Most studies on territoriality
                  have been conducted for a similar species, <em>U. pugilator</em>.
                  Crab density likely plays an important role in territory size,
                  but have been measured at about 100 cm<sup>2</sup> for some populations
                  (Pratt &amp; McLain 2006). Combat among males ranges from no
                  contact to use of the major claw to push, grip or flip the opponent
                  (Pratt &amp; McLain 2006). Territoriality varies, and males
                  are most aggressive toward intruders attempting burrow take-overs
                  and similarly-sized male neighbors that may threaten mating
                  success.</font></p>

                  <font color="000080">Although they are occasionally cannibalistic,
                  the majority of the fiddler crab diet consists of detritus,
                  bacteria and algae on and in the sediments (Genoni 1985, 1991;
                  Gosner 1978). The small claws transfer sediment to the mouthparts,
                  where food is separated from sand and other unwanted particles.
                  Food is swallowed and the mouthparts roll the remaining sand
                  into tiny balls that are placed back on the ground. These balls
                  are much smaller than those created during the excavation of
                  burrows (Ruppert &amp; Fox 1988). Mouthparts in many fiddlers
                  are specialized for a specific size range of sediment particles,
                  and this adaptation is partly responsible for the habitat and
                  distribution of species. The mudflat fiddler is commonly found
                  in medium sand, where it uses spoon-shaped bristles, called
                  setae, to clean adhered detritus and other particles from single
                  grains of sand (Bezerra <em>et al.</em> 2006, Maitland 1990,
                  Miller 1961). Crabs also wander while feeding and some species
                  move as far as 50 m away from their burrows (Ruppert &amp; Fox
                  1988). Studies on feeding behaviors in <em>U. rapax</em> document
                  foraging excursions up to 2 m from the burrow, and crabs have
                  advanced homing abilities that allow them to find their burrows
                  regardless of orientation or obstacles (Layne <em>et al.</em>
                  2003). </font><br>

                  <font color="000080">Predators of fiddler crabs include: birds,
                  fishes, turtles, and mammals such as otters and raccoons (Colby
                  &amp; Fonseca 1984, Crane 1975, Ruppert &amp; Fox 1988), in
                  addition to being occasionally cannibalized by other fiddlers
                  (Gosner 1978). Crabs reduce predation risk by fleeing into their
                  burrows or hiding between marsh grasses and mangrove roots.
                  Larvae of <em>Uca</em> spp. are preyed upon by a variety of
                  pelagic and benthic organisms, and are cannibalized by adult
                  fiddler crabs in captive populations (O'Connor 1990).</font><br>

                  include trematodes such as: <em>Probolocoryphe lanceolata</em>
                  in the hepatopancreas , <em>Maritrema prosthometra</em> in the
                  thoracic musculature, and <em>Gynaecotyla adunca</em> in the
                  antennal gland (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2007). Mudflat fiddlers
                  are also infected by the larvae of the spiny-headed acanthocephalan
                  worm <em>Arhythmorhynchus frassoni</em>, which usually complete
                  their life cycle as endoparasites in the digestive tract of

                  <font color="000080">Many species of fungi are obligate associates
                  of arthropod hosts (Mattson 1988). Fungi belonging to the genera
                  <em>Enterobryus</em> and <em>Taeniella</em> have been discovered
                  in the hindgut of <em>U. rapax</em>. These species are not parasitic
                  (Hibbits 1978, Lichtwardt 1976), and it has been suggested that
                  they may even provide necessary chemical compounds, such as
                  amino acids, to the crab (Williams &amp; Lichtwardt 1972). In
                  addition to obligate associations, mudflat fiddler crabs are
                  found alongside several organisms common to mangroves and salt
                  marshes. For extensive lists of other species found throughout

                  activity often increases when food is limited to create a more
                  abundant nutrient source, but also results in the stimulated
                  growth of nearby mangroves and <em>Spartina</em> plants (Genoni
