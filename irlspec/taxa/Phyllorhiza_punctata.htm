<i>Phyllorhiza punctata</i> is a large jellyfish with a rounded and somewhat flattened gelatinous
bell that is clear or possibly tinted brown with many small
white crystalline refractive spots close to the surface
(Graham et al. 2003, Perry and Larsen 2004).  As is characteristic of members
of Order Rhizostomae, the bell margin lacks tentacles and the central mouth
area is ringed by eight highly dichotomous (branching) oral arms that each bear
14 lappets (flaps of tissue) and become fused near their bases (Graham et al.
2003, Omori and Kitamura 2004).  Within it's native range and in certain
introduced localities, symbiotic zooxanthellae reside in the
tissue of the animal, giving these jellyfish a brownish tint.

              <i>P. punctata</i> is a coastal and estuarine jellyfish whose wide
              native distribution includes Australia and much of the
              Indo-Pacific including the Philippine archipelago (Heeger et al.
              1992).
<br><br>
              Regionally, populations of <i>P. punctata</i> have persisted within a
              few  isolated Caribbean lagoon systems (e.g., Puerto Rico) for at
              least four decades.  More recently, established populations have
              been reported in Brazil (Haddad and Nogueira 2006).  For the last
              several years, an established population has existed in the Gulf of Mexico which may become
              extraordinarily dense under favorable environmental conditions (Graham et al. 2003).

            Spotted jellyfish were first collected from the IRL and identified
            in June, 2001.  St. Johns River Water Management District
            scientists encountered two specimens in the IRL proper near the Melbourne causeway in Brevard County.  One of these was collected
            and transported to Harbor Branch Oceanographic, Fort Pierce, where
it was positively identified as <i>P. punctata</i>.  In light of the
            explosive population of this species in the Gulf of Mexico the
            previous year, the occurence of <i>P. punctata</i> prompted boat and/or aerial surveys of
            the central IRL between Vero Beach and State Road 520 in Cocoa to
            estimate the size of the population.  Approximately 10-12
            individuals were spotted by the aerial survey.  Survey leader W.M.
            Graham of Dauphin Island Sea Lab, Alabama, estimated the actual
            population at that time to be approximately ten times that number,
            based on extensive survey experience gained while following the
            Gulf of Mexico population explosion (W.M. Graham, personal
            communication).

            <i>Phyllorhiza punctata</i> is a large jellyfish whose average adult bell width is
            approximately 35 cm (Perry and Larsen 2004).  Very large
            individuals nearly twice that diameter have also been reported from
            Gulf of Mexico specimens (Graham et al. 2003).

              An explosive summer <i>P. punctata</i> bloom, followed by a
              winter/spring decline or disappearance has occurred in Brazil
              every year since a population became established around 2001. 
              The reasons for these fluctuations are unknown (Haddad
              and Nogueira 2006).  A similar exponential population explosion
              occurred in 2000 in the Gulf of Mexico, although subsequent
              seasonal blooms have not been as large.

            Scyphozoans have a life cycle that can be broadly divided into two
            parts: a free-living medusa (the "jellyfish stage") and an
            attached, sessile polyp stage.  Sexes are separate in the medusae
            and these produce haploid gametes that combine through external
            fertilization to form free-swimming planula larvae.  Planulae
            search out suitable settlement sites and leave the water column to
            assume a sessile benthic existence.  Thse scyphistomae then give
            rise to new offspring in the form of free-swimming medusae. 
            Immature medusae, called ephyrae,  detach from the ends of the
            sessile scyphistomae in a process termed strobilation.  Ephyrae
            develop into mature medusae over a period of usually several weeks
            (Rupert et al. 2004).

            In a Western Australia <i>P. punctata</i> population study, Rippingale and
            Kelly (1995) noted the presence of small (< 2 cm diameter) medusae
            and ephyrae in early summer.  In Brazil, the
            presence of all size classes of <i>P. punctata</i> in late winter and
            spring suggested a prior period of continuous ephyrae release
            synchronized to seasonal high water temperatures and extended
            photoperiod (Haddad and Nogueira 2006).

              Although not rigorously examined, a link between abnormally warm

              suggested (Haddad and Nogueira 2006).

              Though some degree of euryhaline tolerance is expected in an
              estuarine inhabitant, there is some evidence that low salinities
              negatively impact the ability of <i>P. punctata</i> to thrive.
              Rippingdale and Kelly (1995) report the absence of the species from
              Western Australia estuary study sites during low salinity periods
              following heavy rains, and also its return when higher salinity
              conditions returned in the summer months.  Graham et al. (2001),
              suggest that the lack of photosynthetic zoanthellae in Gulf of
              Mexco <i>Phyllorhiza</i> specimens (see below) might be the result of
              hyposalinity stress.

            Like most members of Phylum Cnidaria, the tentacles of <i>Phillorhiza</i>
            are equipped with stinging cells called cnidocytes.  Within these
            cells are stinging organelles called nematocysts.  When discharged,
            nematocysts can immobilize small prey items that are subsequently
            ingested.  Nematocysts are also used as a defense mechanism.
			The planktonic egg and larval stages of several fish species (including commercially important species such as red snapper in the gulf of Mexico) are probably
            important as prey items.
<br><br>
            Additionally, throughout its native range and much of its
            introduced range, <i>P. punctata</i> also harbor endosymbiotic
            zooxanthellae within their bell.  In a relationship analogous to
            that of reef-building tropical corals and their resident
            zooxanthellae, primary production of the photosynthetic
            zooxanthellae likely fulfills a large proportion of the nutritional
            needs of the host jellyfish (Garcia and Durbin 2003).
<br><br>
            The invasive Gulf of Mexico <i>P. punctata</i> populations were/are
            unusual in that they lacked endosymbiotic zooxanthellae (Graham et
            al. 2003).  Zooplanktivory was/is the sole trophic mode of these
            populations which, nonetheless, attained high population numbers.

            <i>P. punctata</i> was recorded only from Indo-Pacific waters prior to the
            1950s.  In 1955, an Atlantic basin population was discovered in
            Brazil (Haddad and Nogueira 2006).  A large population there
            persisted briefly in coastal waters off the southern half of the
            country but disappeared within a few years.  At the time, the
            organism was identified as <i>Mastigias scintillae</i>, another mastigiid
            jellyfish similar in appearance to <i>Phyllorhiza</i> (Moreira 1961, in
            Haddad and Nogueira 2006).  Three decades later, around 1991, a
            second established population of <i>P. punctata</i> was reported from
            Brazil, this time off of the northeastern coastline (Silveira and
            Cornelius 2000).  Ten years later (2001), evidence pointed to a new
            southern population of this non-indigenous jellyfish (Fuller 2005,
            Haddad and Nogueira 2006).  This population may be the result of a
            natural range extension of the established northern population, or alternatively, 
            accidental transport by the shipping industry, or perhaps an irruptive
            event within an extant cryptic population.  Regardless of the
            mechanism, Haddad and Nogueira (2006) believe that <i>P. punctata</i> is
            now widespread in Brazil, occurring in both northern and
            southern waters.  Since 2001, the established <i>P. punctata</i> population in Brazil undergoes a
            large summer bloom, and then declines and disappears the subsequent
            winter and spring (Haddad and Nogueira 2006).
<br><br>
            An established population of spotted jellyfish in a mangrove lagoon
            in Bonqueron Bay, Puerto Rico was reported by Cutress (1973).  The
            first report of the animal in U.S. waters dates to California in
            1981 (Carlton and Geller 1993).  These <i>Phillorhiza</i> invasions pale
            in magnitude to one recorded in the northern Gulf of Mexico off
            Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi in the summer of 2000.  At that
            time, an estimated 10 million <i>P. punctata</i> medusae invaded the
            region and persisted at very high numbers between June and September
            before rapidly declining (graham et al. 2003). Interestingly,
            despite the magnitude of the population explosion, northern Gulf of
            Mexico <i>P. punctata</i> entirely lacked symbiotic zooxanthellae.
<br><br>
            In 2001, <i>P. punctata</i> was identified from collected specimens
            occurring in Florida in the central Indian River Lagoon near the
            city of Melbourne.  Aerial and boat-based surveys undertaken at
            that time revealed only a handful of individuals.  Even fewer
            individuals were detected the following year, and no irruptive
            events have been detected subsequent to this.
<br><br>
            Natural ocean circulation patterns may have been sufficient to
            transport <i>P. punctata</i> up into the northern Gulf of Mexico from
            established Caribbean Sea populations, as has occurred in other
            species (Graham 1998).  Circulation set up by the Loop Current
            (part of teh Gulf Stream; a warm ocean current in the Gulf of
            Mexico that flows northward between Cuba and the Yucatan peninsula)
            and eddies spun off from it may have effected such transport (Johnson
            et al. 2004).
<br><br>
            The precise mechanisms of invasion in each of the above cases
            remain a matter of speculation.  Invasions into new locales may
            occur via attachment of the sessile polyp stages to ship hulls or
            other submerged and towed structures.  Larson and Arneson (1990)
            have proposed hull-fouling as the likely dispersal method
            transporting spotted jellyfish between the Pacific Ocean and the
            Caribbean Atlantic.  Transport of free-swimming stages in ballast
            water has probably also led to some of the invasions (Carlton and
            Geller 1993). Passage of vessels through the Panama Canal probably
            facilitated introduction from the Pacific into the Atlantic basin
            (e.g., Graham et al. 2003, Bolton and Graham 2004).
<br><br>
            The fact that the first documented occurrence of the species in
            Brazil dates back to 1955 suggests that <i>P. punctata</i> was first
            transported between ocean basins at least 50 years ago (Silveira
            and Cornelius 2000)
<br><br>
            Putative transport routes and vectors may be critically examined
            through comparative molecular or morphological analyses among
            various populations. In fact, a recent comparative molecular study
            by Bolton and Graham (2004) concluded that the Brazillian
            population examined was not <i>Phyllorhiza</i>, but rather a member of
            genus <i>Mastigias</i>.

            Non-native jellyfish species like <i>P. punctata</i> have the
            capacity to compete with native species for food resources.  To
            what extent such competition occurs is unknown, as are its
            ecological ramifications. <i>P. punctata</i> may also compete with
            other taxa for food resources (see below). </font></p>

		    Direct negative economic impact of the 2000 Gulf of Mexico <i>P.
		    punctata</i> population explosion included several million dollars of
		    fishery losses, primarily due to net damage.  Some evidence also
		    points to a greater than 25% reduction in the northern Gulf of
		    Mexico white shrimp (<i>Penaeus setiferus</i>) harvest at that time,
		    attributable to competition between the shrimp and jellyfish for
		    food resources. (Graham et al. 2003).  Predation on pelagic fish
		    eggs and bivalve larvae was also pronounced (Graham et al. 2003).
