   <p class="title">Species Description</p>
              <p class="body"><em>Archosargus probatocephalus</em> is a deep-bodied, compressed
              fish that reaches 91 cm (35.8 inches) in length, and 9.6 kg (21.2
              pounds) or more in weight. The back is elevated behind the head,
              which is deep and sloping in profile. The snout is short with the
              mouth inferior and nearly horizontal. The anterior teeth are incisor-like,
              with posterior molars set further back. There are 6-7 gill rakers
              on lower limb of the first gill arch. Scales are finely serrate.
              There is a single dorsal fin, the spinous portion of which is more
              elongate than the soft portion. There are 12 strong dorsal spines
              and 10-12 soft rays. The anal fin bears 3 spines, the second of
              which is the most enlarged, and 10-11 soft rays. The caudal fin
              is forked. There are 44-49 lateral line scales. Body color is generally
              gray or green-yellow base color, marked with 5-7 vertical black
              bars. The dorsal, anal and ventral fins are typically black or gray
              to dusky, while the caudal and pectoral fins are more greenish in
              tone. Coloration is more distinct in young fishes (Hildebrand and
              Schroeder 1927; Hoese and Moore 1977; Johnson 1978). Juvenile sheepshead
              are brownish in color and have a median line along the ventral surface.
              In addition to the vertical black bars, there are also 3 black spots:
              one set behind the isthmus, one beneath the pectoral fin base, and
              one set anteriorally to the anal fin (Hildebrand and Cable 1938).

  	<p class="heading">HABITAT AND DISTRIBUTION</p>
    <p class="title">Regional Occurrence</p>
              <p class="body"><em>Archosargus probatocephalus</em> is common on the Atlantic and
              Gulf coasts of the United States. Its range extends from Cape Cod,
              Massachusetts south through Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to Brazil.
              Wanderers are occasionally observed as far north as Nova Scotia.
              It is absent from Bermuda, the West Indies and the Bahamas (Jennings
              1985). </p>

   		<p class="heading">LIFE HISTORY AND POPULATION BIOLOGY</p>
        <p class="title">Age, Size, Lifespan</p>
              <p class="body"><em>Archosargus probatocephalus</em> grow to approximately 91 cm
              (35.8 inches) total length (TL) and 9.6 kg (21.2 pounds), though
              Hildebrand and Schroeder (1927) reported the largest sheepshead
              recorded weighed 66 kg (145.5 pounds). In most areas, however, sheepshead
              never achieve this large a size. Maximum lifespan has been estimated
              at 20 years in Louisiana (Beckman et al. 1991); however most estimates
              from other regions are lower, ranging from 8 years in North Carolina
              (Schwartz 1990) to 14 years in Georgia (Music and Pafford 1984).
              In a Florida study of sheepshead collected from inshore waters,
              the maximum age for males was estimated to be 13 years, while in
              females, maximum age was 16 years (MacDonald unpubl. in Murphy 2000).</p>
            <p class="title">Abundance</p>
              <p class="body">Sheepshead are considered common to abundant throughout the southeastern
              Atlantic states as well as on the Gulf coast (Jennings 1985).</p>
            <p class="title">Reproduction</p>
              <p class="body"><em>Archosargus probatocephalus</em> females in Florida and Georgia
              mature at approximately Age 2 (Tucker 1987). However, they apparently
              mature at somewhat younger ages in Louisiana, where essentially
              all males older than Age 2, and females over Age 1 were found to
              be mature (Render and Wilson 1992). </p>
            <p class="body">Spawning occurs in late winter and early spring in the coastal mid-Atlantic, south Atlantic and Gulf
              of Mexico (Springer
              and Woodburn 1960; Christmas and Waller 1973; Jennings
              1985). Off
              Louisiana, Render and Wilson (1992) reported spawning occurred from
              late February through late April. In Georgia, spawning occurs primarily
              in April (Music and Pafford 1992).</p>
            <p class="body">Though some
              evidence has been put forward that suggests spawning may occur in
              estuaries (Render and Wilson 1992), it is generally believed that
              sheepshead spawn in the nearshore and offshore waters of the continental
              shelf</font>. Evidence from Music and Pafford (1984) and Render
              and Wilson (1992) show that females with hydrated oocytes and post-ovulatory
              females are more commonly collected from nearshore waters than from
              estuaries during the spawning season. </p>
            <p class="body">Sheepshead appear to be fractional
              spawners (Render and Wilson 1992). Estimates of spawning frequency
              are varied, and range from once per day to once every 20 days. (Murphy
              2000). Batch fecundity of females is also widely ranging. Females
              caught in inshore waters had batch fecundities of 1,100 - 40,000
              eggs, while females captured offshore had 14,000 - 250,000 eggs.
              </p>
            <p class="title">Embryology</p>
              <p class="body">Eggs are buoyant and measure approximately 0.8 mm (0.03 inches)
              in diameter. They hatch after 40 hours in water temperatures of
              approximately 25&deg;C (77 &deg;F).
              Larvae are pelagic and measure 2 - 4.5 mm (0.08 - 0.2 inches) in
              length (Johnson 1978). Pigmentation in yolk-sac larvae is restricted
              to one melanophore set at the angle of the jaw, and 3 melanophores
              set ventrally posterior to the vent. Most melanophores disappear
              by the time larvae reach 6 mm (0.24 inches) in length (Mook 1977).
              Larvae persist for approximately 30-40 days, when metamorphosis
              to the juvenile stage occurs, typically at lengths of approximately
              8mm (0.3 inches) standard length (SL) (Tucker and Alshuth 1996).
              </p>
            <p class="body">A study by Parsons and Peters (1989) reported
              growth rates in both larvae and juveniles of Tampa Bay, Florida
              as approximately 0.20 mm (0.008 inches) per day. However, a study
              by Springer and Woodburn (1960) suggests a somewhat faster growth
              rate of 0.35 mm (0.014 inches) per day, as estimated from average
              total lengths for young-of-the-year sheepshead in Tampa Bay during
              June - August.</p>
            <p class="body">Though few studies exist that show growth
              rates in older juveniles and adults, Beckman et al. (1991) reported
              that between Age 1 and Age 2, sheepshead reach approximately 26
              cm (10.2 inches); between Age 2 and 3 they reach fork lengths of
              approximately 30.5 cm (12 inches), and between Age 3 and 4 they
              reach 35 cm (13.8 inches). In Florida, there is an apparent difference
              in growth rates between east coast sheepshead and west coast sheepshead,
              with mean growth rate for Atlantic coast fishes slightly larger
              at age (through Age 5) than Gulf coast fishes (MacDonald unpubl.
              in Murphy 2000). </p>

   	<p class="heading">PHYSICAL TOLERANCES</p>
    <p class="title">Temperature</p>
              <p class="body"><em>Archosargus probatocephalus </em>have been collected from waters
              ranging in temperature from 5 - 35.1&deg;C (41 - 95.2 &deg;F)(Perret
              1971; Johnson 1978). Tampa Bay Juveniles
              have been collected at temperatures ranging from 12.8 - 32.5 8&deg;C
              (55.0 - 90.5 &deg;F) (Springer and Woodburn 1960).</p>
            <p class="title">Salinity</p>
              <p class="body">Sheepshead are a euryhaline species and have been collected from
              waters in where salinity ranged from 0 - 35 parts per thousand (ppt)
              (Springer and Woodburn 1960; Kelly 1965; Perret 1971; Perret and
              Caillouet 1974).</p>
            <p class="title">Parasites</p>
              <p class="body">Parasites of sheepshead include ciliates, nematodes, trematodes,
              and isopods; though infestations with these organisms pose no apparent
              threat to large populations (Norris and Overstreet 1975; Overstreet
              and Howse 1977; Overstreet 1978).</p>
</li>
   <li>
   	<p class="heading">COMMUNITY ECOLOGY</p>
	<p class="title">Trophic Mode</p>
              <p class="body">Sheepshead are omnivores. The larval
              diet consists primarily of copepods, amphipods and other zooplankton
              (Benson 1982). Juveniles under 50 mm (2 inches) in length primarily
              consume ostracods, gammarids, mysids, copepods and polychaete worms,
              and bryozoans (Hildebrand and Cable 1938; Springer and Woodburn
              1960; Sedberry 1987), but will take any soft-bodied organisms found
              in seagrasses. After reaching 50 mm (2 inches) in length, there
              is a dietary shift towards hard-shelled organisms such as bivalve
              mollusks, brachyurans, echinoderms, and barnacles, though small
              fishes are opportunistically consumed as well (Odum et al. 1982;
              Jennings 1985; Sedberry 1978). Adults feed primarily on algae and
              invertebrates. Ogburn (1984) reported that in North Carolina, sheepshead
              consumed twice as much algae as invertebrate species. However, Sedberry
              (1987) reported that for adults of the South Atlantic Bight, bivalves,
              ascidians and echinoderms were important components of the diet
              in sheepshead larger than 350 mm (13.8 inches) Standard length (SL).
              In Georgia, Music and Pafford (1984) reported that sheepshead fed
              primarily on bryozoans, oysters, decapod shrimp, and barnacles.</p>
            <p class="title">Habitats</p>
              <p class="body">Smaller pelagic larvae are generally collected in surface waters
              over sandy bottoms, within estuaries, around seawalls or jetties
              (Spring and Woodburn 1960; Parsons and Peters 1989), nearshore waters,
              estuaries and bays (Jennings 1985; Parsons and Peters 1989). Juveniles
              are most common in seagrasses or over muddy bottoms (Odum and Heald
              1972; Jennings 1985). Upon reaching approximately 40 mm (1.6 inches)
              in length by late summer, juveniles begin leaving nursery areas
              and congregate with adults around stone jetties, piers, wrecks,
              and breakwaters (Jennings 1985). </p>
            <p class="body">Adults favor habitats with some amount of
              topographic relief, and can be common over oyster reefs, piers,
              breakwaters muddy shallows, wrecks, and in the Gulf of Mexico, oil
              platforms (Johnson 1978; Jennings 1985). </p>
            <p class="body">Sheepshead are not truly migratory, but do
              move to offshore spawning grounds with the onset of cooler water
              temperatures in late fall and winter (Gilhen et al. 1976; Jennings
              1985), and return to nearshore waters and estuaries after spawning
              takes place in spring. Music and Pafford (1984) found that tagged
              sheepshead in Georgia never moved more than 100 km (62.5 miles)
              from their tagging sites, with emigrating fishes leaving estuaries
              for nearshore reefs close to the sites where they were initially
              tagged. </p>
            <p class="title">Associated Species</p>
              <p class="body">Sheepshead are commonly landed with white mullet, black mullet,
              jacks, and mojarras (Murphy 2000). </p>

              <p class="body"><b>Commercial fishery</b><br>
              The sheepshead has limited commercial value, though its importance
              as a food fish varies with region (Jennings 1985). Murphy (2000)
              reported annual commercial landings in Florida between 1986-1994
              as 790,000 pounds, declining to 310,000 pounds after 1995, coincident
              with the gill netting ban implemented in 1995 and a minimum size
              limit of 12 inches. Commercial landings are greatest in the central
              coast regions of Florida. On the east coast, landings are greatest
              from Duval and Volusia Counties south to St. Lucie County. On the
              west coast, landings are concentrated in the Tampa Bay and Charlotte
              Harbor areas.</p>
            <p class="body">Between 1987 - 2001, the
              commercial harvest of <em>Archosargus probatocephalus</em> in Florida
              totaled 9.2 million pounds, and was valued at $4.9 million. The
              5 county area encompassing the IRL (Volusia, Brevard, Indian River,
              St. Lucie and Martin Counties) accounted for 3.2 million pound of
              the commercial harvest, which had a value of $1.8 million. This
              ranks the sheepshead thirty-first in in commercial value to IRL
              counties, and twentieth in pounds harvested. </p>
            <p class="body"> Figure 1 below shows the
              dollar value of the sheepshead commercial fishery to IRL counties
              by year. The fishery ranged in value from a high of $175,857 in
              1991, to a low of $78,259 in 1988. Martin County accounted for 32.5%
              of the catch, followed by Brevard (24.8%), St. Lucie (17.4%),Volusia
              (15.7%) and Indian River (9.6%) Counties.</p>

              <p class="title">Recreational Fishery</p>
              <p class="body">Sheepshead are significantly more important as a recreational species
              than a commercial species, with approximately 90-95% of the annual
              statewide catch taken by recreational anglers (Murphy 2000). Throughout
              the 1990s, the average annual catch by recreational anglers on the
              Atlantic coast averaged approximately 1.2 million fish. However,
              this figure has dropped to an average of 432,000 per year since
              1996 (Murphy 2000), with a similar trend noted on Florida's west
              coast.</p>
            <p class="body">Within
              the 5-county area of the Indian River Lagoon, sheepshead are highly
              prized gamefishes. Recreational anglers captured 1.9 million spotted
              seatrout between 1997 - 2004 (Table 4, Figure 3), not counting those
              fishes that were caught and released. The bulk of the recreational
              catch (47.0%) was taken from inland waters outside of the IRL. Approximately
              28.6% of the recreational catch was harvested from IRL waters. Anglers
              fishing to 3 miles offshore accounted for 21.9% of the harvest,
              while those fishing up to 200 miles offshore accounted for only
              1.8% of the total.</p>
