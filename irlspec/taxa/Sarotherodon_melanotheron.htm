</font></b><font size="3" color="#000080">
<i>Sarotherodon melanotheron</i>, the blackchin tilapia, is a pale (variable
light blue, orange, golden yellow) cichlid whose common name refers to the dark
pigmentation usually (but not always) concentrated on the underside of the head
(the chin) in adult animals.  Melanic pigmentation is usually also present on
the posterior edge of the gill (the cleithrum) and on the tips of the soft
dorsal rays.  Irregular bars, spots or splotches on the body are also typical. 
The mouth is small and filled with up to several hundred very small teeth
arranged in 3-6 rows (Trewevas 1983)
<br><br>
Sexual dimorphism is minimal in the blackchin tilapia (Trewevas 1983), although
the heads of adult males are usually slightly larger than those of females and
some males also have some gold coloration on their opercula.
<br><br>
The spine/ray count is: Dorsal = XV-XVI + 10-12; Anal = 8-10 (FishBase).

            <i>S. melanotheron</i> is a demersal (bottom-associated) species
            inhabiting fresh to brackish water where it occurs.  It is a
            tropical west African native occurring from Senegal to Zaire and
            southern Cameroon (Trewevas 1983, Robbins et al. 1991).  The
            species is common in quiet muddy backwater habitats where aquatic
            vegetation is abundant (Jennings and Williams 1992).  Outside of
            its native range, blackchin tilapia have been introduced to several
            countries across Asia, North America, and Europe (Wohlfarth and
            Hulata 1983).
<br><br>
            Florida is the only state in the Gulf region in which <i>S.
            melanotheron</i> has become established (Courteney et al. 1991,
            Jennings and Williams 1992). In Florida, blackchin tilapia have
            been collected on the Gulf coast from freshwater and brackish
            habitats in Hillsborough County southward to Manatee County
            including the eastern shore of Tampa Bay (Courtenay et al. 1984).
            Specimens have also been collected from Alachua, Palm Beach, and
            Pinellas counties.
<br><br>
            The species is also established on Florida's east coast within the
            IRL watershed (see below).

            <p><b><font size="3" color="#008080">IRL Distribution:</font></b><font size="3" color="000080"><br>
            Within the IRL watershed, blackchin tilapia have been collected in
            Brevard, Indian River and Palm Beach counties.  It is well
            established in Brevard County and may be established in the other
            IRL counties as well. <i>S. melanotheron</i> can now be found from Cocoa Beach
            in Brevard County south to around Vero Beach in Indian River
            County.  In Brevard County, blackchin tilapia occupy the estuary
            proper as well as adjacent drainage canal networks and mosquito
            impoundment marshes (Dial and Wainright 1983, Courtenay et al.
            1984, Jennings and Williams 1992).
<br><br>
            Northward expansion beyond the IRL is likely limited by winter
            water temperatures, although southward expansion appears not to be
            temperature limited (Jennings 1991, Jennings and Williams 1992).

            Blackchin tilapia have been reported to reach 28 cm standard length (SL)
            (Olaosebikan and Raji 1998).  In Florida, they commonly attain 22
            cm standard length and 24 cm SL is possible (Finucane and Rinckey
            1964, Hensley and Courtenay 1980).

            This exotic species can be extremely abundant on local scales. 
            Courtenay et al. (1974) suggested that the <i>S. melanotheron</i>
            population in Lithia Springs, Florida, accounted for 90% of the
            total fish biomass in that system.  The authors also speculated
            that similarly large <i>S. melanotheron</i> populations were established in
            the Tampa Bay area.
<br><br>
            Within a seasonally impounded IRL mangrove ecosystem, Faunce (2000,
            personal communication) reported that blackchin tilapia were the
            dominant fish species by weight.  Dial and Wainright (1983) report
            abundance of the species in the IRL in estuarine shallows and
            within the extensive drainage canal network.

            Over its natural range, spawning occurs year-round, but activity
            declines in periods of heavy rainfall (Trewevas 1983).
<br><br>
            In Florida, spawning has been observed form March to November.  In
            the IRL region, Faunce (2000) observed spawning from April to
            October but gonadosomatic indices revealed that spawning activity
            peaked in April and May.
<br><br>
            Trewevas (1983) reports the formation of stable breeding pairs with
            females initiating courtship and nest construction and males
            mouth-brooding the eggs and young.  Females will aggressively
            defend nest sites while males are mouth-brooding (Jennings and
            Williams 1992).
<br><br>
            Trewevas (1983) also indicated that <i>S. melanotheron</i> can achieve
            sexual maturity at a very small body size, a trait of adaptive
            advantage for an opportunistic invasive species.

            Females produce a clutch of approximately 50 orange eggs that vary
            from 1.5-4.5 mm in diameter depending on the size of the female.
            Incubation within the buccal cavity ("mouth brooding") by the male
            ranges from 6-22 days, averaging about 14 days (Finucane and

              <i>S. melanotheron</i> is a tropical species whose native range in the
              northern hemisphere extends from the equator to 18&#186;N (FishBase)
              and winter temperature extremes are likely the factor most
              limiting factor northward range expansion (Shafland and Pestrak
              1982, Jennings 1991, Jennings and Williams 1992).
<br><br>
              A lethal low temperature of 10.3&#186;C has been established by
              Shafland and Pestrak (1982) who suggested that Daytona Beach
              represented the probable northern limit of the expanding range of
              this species in Florida.  Other reports indicate Florida
              blackchin tilapia populations can survive seasonal low
              temperatures of around 9&#186;C (Springer and Finucane 1963,
              Crittenden in Finucane and Rickley 1964).
<br><br>
              In the late 1980s in the IRL near Merritt Island, blackchin
              tilapia suffered a widespread thermal fishkill when winter air
              temperatures fell to 0&#186;C (Snodgrass 1989).
<br><br>
              Finucane and Rickley (1964), suggested spawning would cease below
              25&#186;C for spawning to occur while Schreitmuller in Trewevas (1983)
              reported failure of breeding pairs to successfully rear young at
              temperatures below 23&#186;C.

 </font></p>
              
            <p><font color="#008080"><b>Salinity:<br></b><font color="000080">
            Blackchin tilapia are broadly euryhaline, primarily inhabiting
            estuarine habitats such as mangrove marshes, and travel freely
            between fresh and saltwater environments (Trewevas 1983, Shafland
            1996).  They frequent the saline lower reaches of streams and are
            also tolerant of hypersaline conditions that may arise in enclosed
            lagoons and impounded marshes (Page and Burr 1991).
<br><br>
            Although the IRL watershed canals and ditches that are home to many
            blackchin tilapia typically do not exceed 10 ppt, individuals have
            survived experimental exposure to salinities that are ten times
            that level (Jennings and Williams 1992).  This fish is capable of
            spawning both in full seawater and in pure freshwater (Shaw and
            Aronson in Trewevas 1983, Jennings and Williams 1992).
<br><br>
            Within the Brevard County portions of the IRL watershed, <i>S.
            melanotheron</i> persists in freshwater as well as at salinities of up
            to 30 ppt (Dial and Wainright 1983, Snodgrass 1989).

            Blackchin tilapia exhibit an ontogenic dietary shift, switching
            from a more carnivorous habit as juveniles to an adult diet that
            focuses mainly on detritus, algae, periphyton and the organisms and
            material inhabiting or fouling submerged hard surfaces (Hensley and Courtenay
            1980, Diouf 1996).  The many small teeth, with their spoon-shaped
            crowns, are well-suited to such a diet (Trewevas 1983).

           The blackchin tilapia was the first of at least six species of
           tilapia that have been released into Florida environments (Shafland
           1996).  The species was originally imported into the United States
           to be raised and sold for the aquarium trade (Axelrod and Schultz
           1955).  Initial release to the natural environment was most likely
           an accidental escape from a west coast fish farm in the mid-1950s.
<br><br>
           Introduction of blackchin tilapia to Florida waters initially
           occurred near Tampa Bay in the 1950s, through release associated
           with the aquarium trade (Springer and Finucane 1963, Courtenay and
           Robins 1973, Hensley and Courtenay 1980, Jennings and Williams 1992).  The
           first records confirming collection of this species from the wild on
           the west coast of Florida date to 1959 (Springer and Finucane
           1963).
<br><br>
           The east coast IRL watershed blackchin tilapia population became
           established substantially later; the first reported collection from
           the wild dates to 1980 from Satellite Beach in Brevard County (Dial
           and Wainright 1983).
<br><br>
           The east coast population may also derive from aquarium releases or
           aquaculture escapes, although there is some speculation that it
           resulted from an intentional introduction by fishermen (Dial and
           Wainright 1983, Jennings and Williams 1992).  One additional IRL
           introduction pathway has been proposed that points to escape of this
           species from an ornamental pond located at the Satellite Beach Civic
           Center where it was used to control the growth of algae (Dial and
           Wainright 1983).  Regardless of the actual mechanism, authors have
           suggested Satellite Beach as the likely epicenter for the east coast
           <i>S. melanotheron</i> introduction (Dial and Wainright 1983, Jennings and
           Williams 1992).
<br><br>
           Thermal tolerance limits may restrict northward expansion of the
           Florida range of blackchin tilapia, but there appears to be no
           similar mechanism limiting southward range expansion (Snodgrass
           1989, Jennings and Williams 1992).

            <p><b><font size="3" color="#008080">Potential to Compete With Natives:<br></font></b><font size="3" color="#008080"><font color="000080">
            Large populations of <i>S. melanotheron</i> likely compete with
            native fish populations for resources. Courtenay et al. (1974)
            provide circumstantial evidence, noting a malnourished and diseased
            appearance in largemouth bass and bluegills co-occurring with
            non-native blackchin tilapia in a Florida freshwater spring.  In
            addition to dietary items, blackchin tilapia may compete with other
            species for breeding and nesting space, as is typical for cichlids.
<br><br>
            Direct predation of <i>S. melanotheron</i> on co-occurring native species
            may be less important than competitive interactions.  Given their
            adaptability and euryhaline habit, however, the species
            nevertheless has the ability to dominate systems it invades
            potentially resulting in biodiversity reduction (Dial and Wainright
            1983). FishBase rates the resilience of <i>S. melanotheron</i> as "medium"
            based on an estimated minimum population doubling time of 1.4 - 4.4
            years.
<br><br>
            Established populations of blackchin tilapia have been associated
            with a reduction of aquatic vegetation due to overgrazing
            (Courtenay et al. 1974).

            <p><b><font size="3" color="#008080">Possible Economic Consequences of Invasion:<br></font></b><font size="3" color="#008080"><font color="000080">
            Blackchin tilapia have been exploited as a food resource in their
            native range, and have been utilized as an aquaculture and
            non-native fishery species elsewhere as well.  Early records of
            commercial utilization in Florida date from 1959, when the species
            was marketed under the name "African sunfish" (Springer and
            Finucane 1963).  <i>S. melanotheron</i> taken from Florida waters are
            included as commercial fishery landings, but no estimate on the
            value of this fishery component has been assessed.
<br><br>
            No studies have been reported that fully evaluate the economic
            impacts this exotic fish has had on freshwater, marine, and
            estuarine systems in Florida.
