<font size="3" color="#0099FF"><br>
</font>
</font>
<font color="#000080" size="3">
<i>R. marmoratus</i> has the widest range of any of the <a href="#neotropical" onClick="popDef('Zoogeographical region consisting of the West Indies, central America and South America', '#neotropical');" name="neotropical">neotropical</a> Aplochilidae
(Taylor, Davis and Turner 1995), and its distribution closely parallels that of
the red mangrove (<i>Rhizophora mangle</i>). Distributed from central Florida,
through the Bahamas and the Caribbean to southern Brazil (Taylor, Davis and
Turner 1995; Huber 1996), <i>R. marmoratus</i> commonly colonizes microhabitats
in mangrove forests. Florida is the northern limit of this species' range.
(Taylor, Davis and Turner 1995).</font></p>
<p><b><font size="3" color="#008080">IRL Distribution:<br>
</font>
</b><font size="3" color="#000080"><i>R. marmoratus</i> is widely distributed but has been considered locally
rare throughout Florida (Taylor, Davis and Turner 1995). However, Taylor (1992)
suggested that this fish may be more abundant than has been assumed, but may be
rarely seen because it inhabits marginal habitats and obscure areas. In the IRL
and along the east coast of central Florida, this species prefers unimpounded,
high marsh habitats inside the burrows of <i>Cardisoma guanhumi</i>, the great land crab. In the Everglades and throughout Florida's west coast, these fish
are generally found in stagnant and seasonal pools, as well as in mosquito
ditches in mangrove habitats.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#000080">Taylor, Davis and Turner (1995) found that
along the central regions of the IRL, <i>Rivulus marmoratus</i> is found
primarily in the high marsh above the <a href="#intertidal" onClick="popDef('Shore zone delineated by the points of the highest and lowest tidal levels', '#intertidal');" name="intertidal">intertidal</a> zone. These areas are flooded
only seasonally, after very high tides, or by heavy rainfall. The tremendous
structural and hydrological alteration of this prime habitat due to impoundment
for mosquito control may have led to the extirpation of <i>R. marmoratus</i>
from many of these areas. Taylor, Davis and Turner (1995) collected only 5
individuals from approximately 3000 hectares of impounded marsh, while over 600
individuals were collected from 1000 hectares of unimpounded marsh.</font></p>
<p><br>
<b><font size="4" color="#000080">III. LIFE HISTORY AND POPULATION BIOLOGY<br>
</font><font size="3" color="#008080">Age, Size, Lifespan:<br>
</font>
</b><font size="3" color="#000080"><i>R. marmoratus</i> collected in the Indian River Lagoon
ranged in length between 11- 37 mm (SL). Maximum size is approximately 50 mm.</font></p>
<p><b><font size="3" color="#008080">Abundance:<br>
</font>
</b><font size="3" color="#000080">Though it has a wide range and distribution, <i>R. marmoratus</i>
has generally been considered locally rare. However, Taylor (1992) suggested
that the species is likely more abundant than originally thought, but because it
inhabits marginal habitats, it is rarely seen.</font></p>
<p><b><font size="3" color="#008080">Locomotion:<br>
</font>
</b><font size="3" color="#000080">Moves primarily by swimming; although it has been observed to
&quot;flip&quot; out of water to escape predation. It has also been observed
moving amphibiously between ponds or burrows.</font></p>
<p><b><font size="3" color="#008080">Reproduction:<br>
</font>
</b><font size="3" color="#000080">Natural populations of <i>R. marmoratus</i> are self-fertilizing
hermaphrodites (Harrington and Rivas 1958, Thomerson 1965), the only natural example of
cloning among vertebrates (Taylor, Davis and Turner 1995). The adult population
in Florida consists almost solely (&gt;99%) of arrays of homozygous clones
(Davis, Taylor and Turner 1990). Davis, Taylor and Turner (1990) speculated that
there may be a relationship between self fertilization in this species, and its
ability to disperse widely and colonize marginal or seasonal habitat areas. The
gonads of <i>R. marmoratus</i> are actually ovotestes that produce both eggs and
sperm. DNA testing has shown that in spite of the fact that this species is
clonal in nature, the genetic diversity within populations approaches that of
sexually reproducing organisms, with the actual number of distinct clones being
quite high.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3">Pure males are occasionally present in natural
populations. In offshore cays in Belize, males may comprise 20-25% of the
population. Throughout Central and South America, males in highly
colonized pools can average between 3-8% of the total population. The presence
of heterozygotes in these populations provides evidence that genetic outcrossing
does occasionally occur (Taylor, Davis and Turner 1990, 1995). In Florida, males
are extremely rare, with a total of just 6 being collected from the west coast
of Florida and the Everglades area (Davis, Taylor and Turner 1990). No males
have been collected in the Indian River Lagoon. Taylor, Davis and Turner (1995)
have hypothesized that the presence of pure male fish and heterozygotes in a
population may be a response to some ecological stress or disturbance. They
support this hypothesis by stating that male <i>R. marmoratus</i> can be easily
produced in the laboratory by manipulating thermal conditions; and, that among
populations sampled in Belize, more males and heterozygotes are collected in
highly disturbed areas than from less disturbed areas.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#000080">Cole and Noakes (1997) studied gonadal
development in laboratory reared specimens of <i>R. marmoratus</i> from Florida
ancestors. All the fish examined in this study were less than 150 days old. This
experimental population consisted of 63% pure females, 14% pure males, and 21%
hermaphrodites. This study provided the first evidence that young adults of <i>R.
marmoratus</i> sexually outcross. Since natural populations do not show this
demographic, it was suggested that there may be an age-dependent shift in sex
allocation from a female dominated population to a hermaphroditic population.
This shift is somewhat similar to diandric protogynous hermaphroditism observed
in other teleost fishes, particularly the Gobiidae. In this type of
hermaphroditism, an individual can develop directly as a primary male; or, it
can function first as a female, and later develop into a secondary male while
still retaining female function (Cole and Noakes 1997). This study offers one
possible explanation of how adult populations in Florida are overwhelmingly
dominated by hermaphrodites. It remains for future study to determine whether
the high genetic variability observed in natural populations is due to sexual
reproduction by young adult fish, or to self fertilization by hermaphrodites.</font></p>
<p><b><font size="3" color="#008080">Embryology:<br>
</font>
</b><font size="3" color="#000080">Mature eggs measure over 1 mm in diameter. Eggs are laid near
the surface of the water in various stages of development, with some being
recently fertilized, and others already containing developing embryos (Thomerson
1966). Adults commonly catch and eat spawned eggs as they are released. The
number of eggs released is positively correlated with body size of the adult and
with season (Taylor 1992). Early in the reproductive season, <i>R. marmoratus</i>
lays between 46 - 60 eggs. Later in the season, adult fish generally lay more
than 75 eggs. There is some evidence that eggs may sometimes be <a href="#aestivated" onClick="popDef('Passing a dry season, typically summer, in a dormant or torpid state', '#aestivated');" name="aestivated">aestivated</a>
before hatching, as there are a number of cases where juvenile <i>R. marmoratus</i>
have been observed in isolated ponds and pools after prolonged periods of
drought (Ritchie and Davis 1986, Davis, Taylor and Turner 1995).</font></p>
<p><br>
<b><font size="4" color="#000080">IV. PHYSICAL TOLERANCES<br>
</font><font size="3" color="#008080">Temperature:<br>
</font>
</b><font size="3" color="#000080"><i>R. marmoratus </i>has been collected in water temperatures
ranging from 7 - 38&deg; C (Taylor 1993). When subjected to laboratory temperatures
below 9&deg; C, <i>R. marmoratus</i> became <a href="#moribund" onClick="popDef('Near death;  dying', '#moribund');" name="moribund">moribund</a> (Taylor 1992, 1993). Taylor
(1993) observed a decline in the Indian River Lagoon population following a 1989
freeze event in which air temperatures in Fort Pierce reached 7.2&deg; C (45 &deg;F), and water temperatures reached 11.1&deg; C (52&deg; F). While some thermal
buffering by land crab burrows undoubtedly occurred, it apparently was
insufficient to protect <i>R. marmoratus</i> from the extreme cold, as specimens
of this fish were not collected again for 8-17 months following the freeze.</font></p>
<p><b><font size="3" color="#008080">Salinity:<br>
</font>
</b><font size="3" color="#000080"><i>R. marmoratus</i> is highly <a href="#euryhaline" onClick="popDef('Organisms tolerant of widely ranging salinity', '#euryhaline');" name="euryhaline">euryhaline</a> (Taylor, Davis and

<p><font color="#008080"><b><font size="3">Other Physical Tolerances:</font></b><font size="3">&nbsp;<br>
</font></font><font color="#000080" size="3">
In addition to tolerating extremes in salinity and temperature, <i>R. marmoratus</i>
also tolerates high sulfide levels. As such, it is generally found in areas
depauperate of other fish species, such as crab burrows, stagnant pools and
impounded ditches. Davis, Taylor and Turner (1990) observed that <i>R.
marmoratus</i> inhabiting crab burrows often had a milky white coating on their
body surfaces which sloughed off after capture. The authors interpreted this
unusual character to an epidermal or mucous reaction to high sulfide levels in
the burrow. Additionally, fish in these stagnant burrows that became caught in
fully submerged traps were often observed to &quot;drown.&quot;. It is thought
that this response is another reaction to high sulfide levels within the
burrows. It had been observed in the laboratory that when <i>R. marmoratus</i>
is emersed, it tends to be extremely quiescent, not even ventilating its gills.
At the time, it was thought that this was a voluntary response; but in light of
the observed &quot;drowning&quot; observed in the burrows, the authors
speculated that perhaps quiescence while emersed is a response to stagnant
conditions, and is used when these fish are unable to emerge from burrows
containing lethal hydrogen sulfide concentrations (Davis, Taylor and Turner
1990).</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#000080">Abel et al. (1987) found that <i>Rivulus
marmoratus</i> was fully capable of surviving longer than 30 days in moist

<i>R. marmoratus </i>feeds on both terrestrial and aquatic animals (Taylor
1992). In one study, up to 40% of the fish collected had no food items present
in the gut. This observation indicates that <i>R. marmoratus</i> may be an
opportunistic feeder when confined in crab burrows, but probably feeds heavily
when its marsh habitat becomes flooded (Taylor 1988, 1992). Small flying insects
and ants comprised approximately 30% of the diet of <i>R. marmoratus</i>, while
aquatic organisms such as polychaete worms, gastropods and mollusks accounted
for approximately 70% of the diet (Taylor 1992). Fry of <i>Rivulus marmoratus</i>
prey upon first instar larvae of <i>Ades taeniorhynchus</i>, adults fish prey on
fourth instar <i>Ades</i> mosquitoes and larvae of <i>Culex quinquefasciatus</i>
(Taylor, Ritchie and Johnson 1992).</font></p>

burrows less than 1 m in depth. Captures of 1 - 2 individuals are common, with
as many as 26 fish being captured from a single burrow.</font></p>

</font>
</b><font size="3" color="#000080">Along the east coast of central Florida, <i>Rivulus

thus allowing this species to establish itself north of its thermal tolerance
limits.</font></p>
