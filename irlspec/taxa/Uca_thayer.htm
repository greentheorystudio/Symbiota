                  the family Ocypodidae (Rosenberg 2001). Members of this family
                  are characterized by a thick, squarish body and herding behavior

                  examination of body color and claw structure. The carapace and

                  (Crane 1975, Kaplan 1988), and both fingers of the claw are

                  <br>
                  <font color="000080">The <strong>Atlantic sand fiddler</strong>
                  is mostly white to yellowish white, becoming paler during courtship
                  (Crane 1975). Displaying males have a characteristic pink or
                  purple patch on the middle of the carapace, which is often mottled
                  brown in non-displaying males. The major cheliped (appendage
                  bearing the major claw) of the male is yellowish white, often
                  with pale orange at the base of the claw. The minor claw is
                  white, and the eyestalks are buff to grayish white, never green.
                  Many tubercles or bumps cover the outer surfaces of the claw.
                  However, the oblique ridge of tubercles common in several fiddler
                  crab species is absent in <em>U. pugilator</em>. Most populations
                  of <em>U. pugilator</em> inhabit sandy shores from Massachusetts
                  to Florida (Kaplan 1988), the Gulf of Mexico from Florida to
                  Texas, and the Bahamas (Crane 1975).</font></p>
                <p><font color="000080">The <strong>saltpan fiddler</strong> is
                  small, with a carapace length of about 1.2 cm (Kaplan 1988).
                  The body is dark mottled brown, with red or pink on the carapace
                  and red on the major claw. Walking legs are usually brown or
                  striped with gray, and the palm of the major claw bears large
                  tubercles. Most populations of <em>U. burgersi</em> are found
                  in mud or muddy sand around mangroves or near the mouths of
                  streams from eastern Florida to South America.</font></p>
                <p><font color="000080">The <strong>redjointed fiddler</strong>
                  is large, with a carapace width reaching 2.3 cm (Kaplan 1988).
                  It is aptly named for the red bands present on the joints of
                  the appendages. The large claw bears many tubercles, which diminish
                  to granules toward the bottom, and the upper finger curves down
                  below the tip of the lower (Kaplan 1988). This species prefers
                  muddy sediments around <em>Spartina</em> marshes, from brackish
                  to nearly freshwater, in Massachusetts to northern Florida and
                  Louisiana.</font></p>
                <p><font color="000080">The <strong>Atlantic marsh fiddler</strong>,
                  <em>U. pugnax</em>, has a carapace approximately 1.2 cm long
                  (Kaplan 1988). The body is usually brown or yellowish with a
                  row of tubercles on the palm of the major claw (Ruppert &amp;
                  Fox 1988). This species is most abundant in muddy areas of salt
                  marshes from Massachusetts to eastern Florida (Kaplan 1988).<br>
                  <br>
                  The carapace of the <strong>mudflat fiddler</strong>, <em>U.
                  rapax</em>, is about 2.1 cm long and light tan in color (Kaplan
                  1988). The color of the major claw is similar, with a darker
                  lower palm and finger. The center of the palm is almost smooth,
                  but still bears small granules. This species inhabits mud banks
                  near mangroves and mouths of streams from Florida to South America.
                  Crane (1975) defines the Daytona Beach area on the east coast
                  of Florida as the northern limit for <em>U rapax</em>. The subspecies
                  <em>U. rapax rapax</em> is very similar in appearance (see Crane
                  1975 for diagnostic characteristics).</font><br>
                  <br>
                  <font color="000080">The <strong>longfinger fiddler</strong>,
                  <em>U. speciosa</em>, has a small carapace length of about 1.1
                  cm (Kaplan 1988). Its color is seasonally variable, but usually
                  remains darker than the characteristic brilliant white of the
                  major claw. The palm bears a slightly curved row of large tubercles.
                  These crabs inhabit muddy areas, mostly around mangroves from
                  Florida to Cuba.</font></p>

                  other brachyuran crabs (Teal 1958<font color="000080">).
                  Densities recorded for <em>U. thayeri</em> populations in the

                <p><font color="008080"><strong>Molting &amp; Limb Regeneration:</strong></font><br>
                  <font color="000080">Like other arthropods, fiddler crabs must
                  molt in order to grow larger. This process, known as "ecdysis",
                  occurs most frequently in fast-growing juveniles and slows during
                  adulthood (da Silva Castiglioni <em>et al.</em> 2007). During
                  ecdysis, the hard exoskeleton is shed in one piece, exposing
                  the new, soft underlying skeleton. Water is pumped into the
                  body to expand the size of the new exoskeleton before it hardens
                  (<em>eg.</em> Guyselman 1953). Molting is not only used for
                  growth, but also to regenerate missing limbs. During combat
                  or to escape from predators, fiddler crabs autotomize or cast
                  off limbs at a predetermined point (Weis 1977), usually at the
                  base of all walking legs (Hopkins 2001). New limbs grow in a
                  folded position within a layer of the cuticle, unfolding and
                  expanding during the molting process. Ecdysis is triggered and
                  accelerated by multiple autonomy and removal of the eyestalks
                  (Abramowitz &amp; Abramowitz 1940, Hopkins 1982). Molting under
                  these circumstances may not result in growth, and the overall
                  size of the crab may even decrease as energy is used to regenerate
                  several missing limbs (Hopkins 1982). A single molt in some
                  individuals is often enough to completely regenerate a missing
                  limb (Hopkins 2001), but other crabs may require several molts
                  before an appendage is restored to its original size. Several
                  factors affect the frequency and success of molting and limb
                  regeneration, including food availability, temperature and pollution.
                  The presence of methylmercury in polluted waters can partially
                  or fully inhibit regeneration of limbs in both temperate and
                  tropical fiddler crabs (Weis 1977). When compared to <em>U.
                  pugilator</em> and <em>U. rapax</em>, <em>U. thayeri</em> exhibited
                  slower regeneration of limbs and hardening of the carapace after
                  ecdysis when inhabiting waters with heavy metal pollutants.
                  For example, the Atlantic mangrove fiddler also regenerated
                  slower in cooler temperatures and ceased regeneration when placed
                  in large groups.<br>

                  engage in elaborate mating displays before copulation. Males
                  use their large claw to attract mates through a series of waving
                  motions and acoustic drumming, also used to ward off potential
                  competitors. Waving displays are often characteristic of a certain
                  species, but usually occur at the mouth of the burrow in all
                  crabs. In <em>U. thayeri</em>, the large claw makes a near vertical
                  loop, jerking 2-4 times as it is brought up (Crane 1975). Individual
                  waves last about 0.5 s, comprising larger displays that can
                  occur over several seconds to many minutes. Often, acoustic
                  drumming and other sounds are produced by the claws and legs
                  to attract females (Crane 1975). Atlantic mangrove fiddler crabs
                  court and mate both during the day and at night. In daylight,
                  waving displays by males are likely most important; whereas,
                  acoustic signals predominate during nocturnal courtship. Once
                  the male has attracted a mate, she usually follows him into
                  the burrow for copulation, although aboveground mating has also
                  been occasionally observed for this species (Salmon 1987). The
                  resulting fertilized eggs are carried in a clump, often called
                  a sponge, on the abdomen of the female until hatching. Reproduction
                  in <em>U. thayeri</em> is seasonal, with ovigerous, or egg-bearing,
                  females present during the warmer months (Costa &amp; Negreiros-Fransozo
                  2003). Though seasonal, reproductive periods in fiddler crabs
                  are usually wide, and females can spawn several egg masses per
                  year (Costa &amp; Negreiros-Fransozo 2003). Most ovigerous females
                  studied in the field ranged between about 1.5 and 2.3 cm in
                  carapace width. Ovigerous <em>U. thayeri</em> also build characteristic
                  chimneys on their burrows. See "Burrowing Behavior" for more
                  information. <br>

                  <font color="000080">Female <em>U. thayeri</em> can carry approximately
                  31,000 eggs at one time, incubating them for 12-14 days at summer
                  temperatures (DeCoursey 1979, Christy 1982<font color="000080">).
                  During this time, most of the yolk is consumed, and larvae hatch
                  with almost no remaining yolk (Christopher <em>et al</em>. 2008).
                  Crabs release larvae into the water column once they are fully
                  developed, usually during large nocturnal ebb tides (<em>eg.</em>
                  Christy 1989), although the hatching rhythms for <em>U. thayeri</em>
                  are most tuned to tidal flows and can occur during both day
                  and night (Weaver &amp; Salmon 2002</font>). The purpose of
                  this behavior is most likely to transport larvae offshore, away
                  from abundant estuarine predators. Planktonic larvae develop
                  through a series of five zoeal stages (Christy 1989), feeding
                  mostly on smaller zooplankton. The final larval stage (postlarva)
                  is the demersal, or bottom-associated, megalopa. As the larvae
                  travel back toward the estuary, they metamorphose into megalopae
                  and look for settlement cues such as the presence of other members
                  of the same species (conspecifics) and the appropriate sediment
                  type, before settling to the bottom and undergoing their final
                  metamorphosis to a juvenile crab (<em>eg.</em> O'Connor 1993).</font></p>

                  <font color="008080"><strong>Burrowing Behavior:</strong></font><br>
                  <font color="000080">Fiddler crabs are known for digging burrows
                  in muddy and/or sandy sediments of sheltered estuarine habitats.
                  These tunnels are used for mating, to escape extreme temperatures
                  and flooding, and as a refuge from predators. The burrows are
                  generally located in the intertidal zone, have only one opening
                  and are usually L-shaped (Ruppert &amp; Barnes 1994). The depth
                  of burrows can be as much as 60 cm (Gosner 1978), but most North
                  American species dig no deeper than 36 cm (Ruppert &amp; Barnes
                  1994). As the crab excavates the burrow during low tide, it
                  transports sediment to the surface by carrying it in the legs
                  of one side, rolling it into small balls and forming a pile
                  at the entrance of the hole (Ruppert &amp; Barnes 1994). When
                  the tide comes in, most crabs retreat into their burrows, placing
                  a sediment plug at the entrance to keep water from inundating
                  the tunnel. Burrowing behavior differs somewhat according to
                  species. In <em>U. thayeri</em>, the males and females excavate
                  burrows, but ovigerous females build tall chimneys of mud at
                  the mouths of their tunnels (Costa <em>et al.</em> 2006, Pratt
                  &amp; McLain 2006, Salmon 1987). These chimneys or funnels
                  can extend up to 10 cm high, and females will rebuild the chimney
                  usually within 24 hours when it is disturbed (Salmon
                  1987). The burrow entrances of non-ovigerous females
                  are usually flush with the surrounding sediment, while males
                  build a small lip around their holes.</font></p>
                <p><strong><font color="008080">Territoriality: </font></strong><br>
                  <font color="000080">Male fiddler crabs use their enlarged claw
                  not only to attract females, but also in territory disputes
                  with other crabs (Pratt &amp; McLain 2006, Ruppert &amp; Barnes
                  1994, Ruppert &amp; Fox 1988). Individual territories are located
                  around a single, centralized burrow. Most studies on territoriality
                  have been conducted for a similar species, <em>U. pugilator</em>.
                  Crab density likely plays an important role in territory size,
                  but have been measured at about 100 cm<sup>2</sup> for some
                  populations (Pratt &amp; McLain 2006). Combat among males ranges
                  from no contact to use of the major claw to push, grip or flip
                  the opponent (Pratt &amp; McLain 2006). Territoriality varies,
                  and males are most aggressive toward intruders attempting burrow
                  take-overs and similarly-sized male neighbors that may threaten
                  mating success. Ovigerous <em>U. thayeri</em> females may also
                  defend their burrows during the mating season (Salmon 1987).</font></p>
                <p><font color="008080"><strong>Trophic Mode:</strong></font><br>
                  <font color="000080">Although they are occasionally cannibalistic,
                  the majority of the diet in fiddler crabs consists of detritus,
                  bacteria and algae on and in the sediments (Gosner 1978). The
                  small claws transfer sediment to the mouthparts, where food
                  is separated from sand and other unwanted particles. Food is
                  swallowed and the mouthparts roll the remaining sand into tiny
                  balls that are placed back on the ground. These balls are much
                  smaller than those created during the excavation of burrows
                  (Ruppert &amp; Fox 1988). Mouthparts in many fiddlers are specialized
                  for a specific size range of sediment particles, and this adaptation
                  is partly responsible for the habitat and distribution of species.
                  The Atlantic mangrove fiddler is commonly found in fine to very
                  fine sediments, where it uses feathery bristles, called setae,
                  to clean adhered detritus and other particles from single grains
                  of sand (Bezerra <em>et al.</em> 2006, Maitland 1990, Miller
                  1961).Crabs also wander while feeding and some species move
                  as far as 50 m away from their burrows (Ruppert &amp; Fox 1988).</font><br>

                  <font color="000080">Predators of fiddler crabs include birds,
                  fishes, turtles, and mammals such as otters and raccoons (Colby
                  &amp; Fonseca 1984, Crane 1975, Ruppert &amp; Fox 1988), in
                  addition to being occasionally cannibalized by other fiddlers
                  (Gosner 1978). Crabs reduce predation risk by fleeing into their
                  burrows or hiding between marsh grasses and mangrove roots.
                  Larvae of <em>Uca</em> spp. are preyed upon by a variety of
                  pelagic and benthic organisms, and are cannibalized by adult
                  fiddler crabs in captive populations (O'Connor 1990).</font><br>

                  activity often increases when food is limited to create a more
                  abundant nutrient source, but also results in the stimulated
                  growth of nearby mangroves and <em>Spartina</em> plants (Genoni
