   	  <p class="title">Species Description</p>
<p class="body">Overall body color of <i>Epinephelus striatus</i> varies from tawny to
pinkish red, with five dark vertical bars. The third and fourth bars branch
above the lateral line and form a &quot;W&quot;. <i>E. striatus</i> can be
distinguished from its congeners by several characteristics: 1) the third
spire of the dorsal fin is longer than the second; 2) the interspinous
membrane is slightly indented; and 3) the caudal fin is slightly emarginated (Jory and Iversen 1989). Although Nassau and
red grouper are similar in overall
appearance, Nassau grouper possesses a black saddle on top of the caudal
peduncle, black spots around the eye and a distinctive tuning-fork shaped
marking on top of the head.</p>

  	<p class="heading">HABITAT AND DISTRIBUTION</p>
    <p class="title">Regional Occurrence</p>
<p class="body">Nassau grouper, along with black and
red grouper, occur from New England to southeastern Brazil, throughout the
Bahamas, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. Occurrences of this species north
of the Carolinas are probably the result of larval transport (Jory and Iversen
1989). In Florida, Nassau grouper are most common in south Florida.
In east central Florida, they are not common.</p>
<p class="title">IRL Distribution</p>
<p class="body"><i>Epinephelus striatus</i> has been infrequently observed
(Gilmore 1977) in the IRL. Juveniles may sometimes be found in grass beds, inlet areas, and in nearshore
habitats; while adult fish are typically observed in rocky reefs offshore to 100
meter depths.</p>
</li>
   <li>
   		<p class="heading">LIFE HISTORY AND POPULATION BIOLOGY</p>
      <p class="title">Age, Size, Lifespan</p>
<p class="body"><i>Epinephelus striatus</i> first matures at or before about 48 cm total
length (TL) and approximately 180 g (Thompson and Munro 1978). It is estimated
that Nassau Grouper can grow between 1.92 - 4.55 mm per month, depending on
initial size, with smaller size fish (175 - 200 mm) growing faster than larger
size fish (326 - 451 mm) (Randall 1962 as cited in Jory and Iversen 1989).</p>
<p class="body">When reared from eggs, larval Nassau grouper
began transformation to the juvenile stage at 42 days post-hatching, and had
finished the transformation as early as 46 days post-hatching and as late as 70
days post-hatching. After 98 days, juvenile Nassau grouper measured 49 - 95 mm
TL and weighed 1.7 - 12.8 g. After 243 days post-hatching, total lengths
were 81 - 203 mm, and weights ranged from 7.0 - 143.1 g (Tucker and Woodward
1993).</p>

<p class="title">Abundance</p>
<p class="body"><i>Epinephelus striatus </i>is an infrequently
observed species in the Indian River Lagoon; however, it is common
throughout much of its range, especially in Bermuda and the Bahamas.</p>

<p class="title">Locomotion</p>
<p class="body">Transport of settlement-stage <i>Epinephelus striatus</i> was studied in
Exuma Sound, Bahamas. Transport of fish took place in tidal passes between
islands during flood tides on moonless nights. Most recruitment of Nassau
grouper during this particular study took place during a 4 day storm which
resulted in considerable cross-shelf transport of water. It was suggested that
the unpredictable nature of this transport could be an underlying factor in the
interannual recruitment variability of fish (Shenker et al 1993). Another study
at Lee Stocking Island, Exumas, Bahamas in January 1989 and 1990, showed that
ingress of pelagic Nassau Grouper though tidal channels lasted about one week
and occurred during nocturnal flood tides. By back calculating from otolith
incrementation, spawning was estimated to have taken place at the time of the
full moon in December. A larval life of 37 - 45 days was also estimated (Colin
et al 1997).</p>

<p class="title">Reproduction</p>
<p class="body">Spawning aggregations in Nassau grouper have been known for some time
throughout the tropical western Atlantic and can be as large as 100,000
individuals (Smith 1972). Aggregations of Nassau grouper are often exploited by
local fishermen (Tucker et al 1993). Spawning aggregations have been documented
in Bimini and southern Berry Islands, Bahamas as well as in Belize, all during
the full moon in January (Smith 1972; Bannerot 1984 and Miller 1984 as cited in
Jory and Iversen 1989); and off Bermuda (Burnett-Herkes 1975 as cited in Jory
and Iversen 1989); and the Virgin Islands (Olsen and LaPlace 1978). Water
temperatures of 25 - 26 &deg;C appear to be the one environmental factor common to
ripe and spawning Nassau grouper throughout its range (Colin 1992; Tucker et al.
1993).</p>
<p class="body">An aggregation of Nassau grouper was described
at the eastern ends of the Cayman Islands, but spawning activity was not
observed. The aggregation occurred around the time of the full moon in January
when Nassau grouper migrated upcurrent to the eastern ends of the islands. The
full moon was considered to be a superior spawning cue primarily for migrating
and spawning adults to coordinate their activities. It was suggested that Cayman
Island populations of Nassau grouper could be self-recruiting (Colin et al
1987). In a later study, Colin (1992) described reproductive behavior in Nassau
Grouper on Long Island, Bahamas, during the winters of 1987 - 1988 and 1988 -
1989: Groupers (~500 individuals per site) aggregated at two sites in December
and January shortly before or at the time of the full moon. Water temperature
was 25.0 - 25.5 &deg;C. There was no size difference between males and females
between months or years. Female to male sex ratios were approximately 5:1 and 3:1. Courtship
took place in late afternoon and spawning began before sunset. Distinct
coloration patterns of males and females representing spawning subgroups of 3 -
25 fish were described. A bicolor pattern was displayed by both female and male
fish thought to be submissive. A dark phase is displayed by female Nassau
grouper that are followed by bicolor fish in courtship. These dark phase females
take the lead in spawning events. Release of gametes (noted by presence of sperm
clouds) takes place well above the bottom, at 3 - 15 meters. At these
study sites, drogue releases indicated that larvae would be retained nearshore
for about one week. The larval period lasts for 35 - 40 days (Colin 1992).</p>
<p class="body">Nassau groupers are considered an excellent candidate for development as an aquaculture species.
Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) has been used successfully to induce spawning in Nassau
grouper (Tucker et
al 1991).</p>
<p class="body">When reared from captive fish, hatching of planktonic eggs took place one day after fertilization and juveniles settled 46 - 70 days later (Tucker and Woodward 1993). Nassau groupers 445 mm standard length (SL) can produce over 785,000 planktonic eggs, 0.90 - 1.02 mm in diameter
(Smith 1961and Manday and Fernandez 1966 as cited in Jory and Iversen 1989). Egg
and larval stages have been described (Manday and Fernandez 1966; Powell and
Tucker 1992).</p>

<p class="title">Embryology</p>
<p class="body">Egg and larval phase are described by Powell and Tucker (1992). They report
egg diameters from laboratory reared specimens of Nassau grouper averaging 0.92
mm and ranging from 0.86 - 0.97 mm in diameter. A single oil globule, 0.24&nbsp;mm
in diameter was present. Planktonic eggs hatched at 27 - 29 hours post
fertilization at 25 &deg;C and 23 - 25 hours at 28 &deg;C. Newly hatched larvae
were 1.7 - 1.8 mm in notochord length (Powell and Tucker 1992).</p>
<p class="body">A hatchery study indicated that a temperature of 26 &deg;C was preferable to higher
temperatures for both incubating eggs and rearing first-feeding larvae. Eggs
were spawned from captive adult Nassau grouper and reared at three temperatures,
26, 28 and 30 &deg;C at 37 ppt salinity on a 12:12 hour photoperiod. Although
hatching success did not vary, incubation time to hatching decreased with
increasing temperature, from 24.9 hours at 26 &deg;C to 20.4 hours at 30 &deg;C.&nbsp;
Development time to first feeding stage also decreased as temperatures
increased, from 86 hours at 26 &deg;C to 71 hours at 30&deg;C. However, survival of
pre-feeding larvae declined at elevated temperatures. Lower temperatures were
also shown to delay starvation of first-feeding stage fish (Watanabe et al
1995). A larval life of 37 - 45 days was estimated (Colin et al 1997).</p>
<p class="body">Johnson and Keener (1984) published a
guide for differentiating larvae of American grouper, including the Nassau
grouper.</p>
</li>
   <li>
   	<p class="heading">PHYSICAL TOLERANCES</p>
    <p class="title">Salinity</p>
<p class="body">Nassau grouper are euryhaline.  It has been reported that Nassau grouper lived for an extended
period in the old New York Aquarium where water was occasionally fresh (Townsend
1905 as cited in Jory and Iversen 1989).</p>
</li>
   <li>
   	<p class="heading">COMMUNITY ECOLOGY</p>
	<p class="title">Trophic Mode</p>
<p class="body">The diet of larger grouper over 300 mm Standard Length (SL) vs.
smaller Nassau grouper consisted of proportionately more fish (53 %) than
crustaceans (39 %). Gut content analyses of 150 Nassau grouper revealed
parrot-fishes, wrasses, damselfish, squirrelfish snapper and grunts. Crustaceans
included crabs, stomatopods, hermit crabs, panulirid lobsters, and both caridean
and penaid shrimp (Randall 1965).</p>
<p class="body">In a feeding ecology study of recruitment in
early-juvenile Nassau grouper (20.2 - 27.8 mm S L), gut content analysis
revealed evidence of filter and particulate feeding as well as piscivory. Food
items ranged from dinoflagellates (80 um in length) to larval fish as large as
9.4 mm SL, thus indicating substantial trophic plasticity during this
transitional phase (Grover 1993), which takes place over the period of
approximately one week (Grover et al 1998). When Nassau groupers were in
the transition phase from pelagic (pre-settlement) to demersal
(post-settlement), it was found that pelagic fish consumed calanoid and
poecilostomatoid copepods as well as decapod larvae. The diet of demersal&nbsp;
Nassau groupers consisted of gammaridean amphipods and harpacticoid copepods.
Six months post-settlement, the diet of these juvenile groupers was comprised
mainly of gammaridean amphipods, but mysids and isopods increased in
importance.</p>
<p class="body">In a hatchery based study, survival of larval
Nassau grouper was greater when larvae were fed smaller sized (117 um) as
opposed to larger sized (161 um) rotifers (Watanabe et al 1996).</p>

<p class="title">Predation</p>
<p class="body">Predation in groupers is not well documented, but small sized grouper are
probably preyed upon by moray eels as well as by larger grouper (Smith
1961 as cited in Jory and Iversen 1989). Sandbar sharks and the great
hammerhead shark have been reported to prey on large grouper (Thompson and Munro
1978 as cited in Jory and Iversen 1989). Yellowtail snapper were seen preying on
freshly released Nassau grouper eggs in the Bahamas (Colin 1992).</p>
<p class="title">Competitors</p>
<p class="body">Because of habitat overlap in groupers, interspecific competition for food
and space is probably common (Thompson and Munro 1978). Jacks, snappers,
barracudas and shark are also considered likely competitors for food (Jory and
Iversen 1989).</p>
<p class="title">Habitat</p>
<p class="body">Nassau grouper (like other grouper) are considered cryptic, occupying
crevices and caves along ledges and reefs as well as shipwrecks (Smith 1961 as
cited in Jory and Iversen 1989).</p>
<p class="body">Juvenile Nassau grouper are common in seagrass
beds of south Florida (Jory and Iversen 1989). Nassau grouper has been
documented in the Indian River Lagoon, FL (Gilmore 1977).</p>
<p class="title">Activity Time</p>
<p class="body">While grouper are known to feed during the day as well as at night, they are
more likely to be actively feeding at dawn and at dusk (Randall 1967 as
cited in Thompson and Munro 1978).</p>
<p class="title">Associated Species</p>
<p class="body">Nassau grouper on coral reefs take advantage of the symbiotic cleaning
behavior of gobies and shrimp, allowing these animals to remove parasitic
isopods from their bodies, fins, mouths and gill chambers (Bohlke and McCosker
1973; Darcey et al 1974; Sargent and Wagenbach 1975).</p>

     <p class="heading">ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>
     <p class="title">Fisheries Importance</p>
<p class="body">Nassau grouper is the most economically important fish in the Bahamas (Colin
1992). In Florida, however, Nassau grouper are not frequently observed, and thus
are not considered a viable fishery species. However, groupers as a whole are
economically important in Florida, and accounted for
approximately $18 million  in revenues from tourism and recreational
fishing activities in 1999. They are also considered excellent candidates
for development as an aquaculture species.</p>
<p class="body">The statewide commercial catch of<i> </i>Nassau
grouper, <i>Epinephelus striatus,</i> between the years 1987 - 2001 was $42,123 pounds, with a dollar value of $70,044. Within the 5 county area
encompassing the IRL (Volusia, Brevard, Indian River, St. Lucie and Martin
Counties) the commercial catch of Nassau grouper during this time period accounts for only 6% of the
statewide total, with a harvest of 2,784 pounds, and a value of $4,275.&nbsp; This
ranks the Nassau grouper ninety-second in commercial value within IRL
counties, and ninety-fifth in pounds harvested.</p>
<p class="body">Figure 1 below shows the dollar value of the Nassau
grouper to IRL counties by year. As shown, the commercial fishery for this
species essentially ended in 1993. Before 1993, Nassau grouper accounted
for only a small fraction of the commercial catch across all species, barely
averaging a value of $800 per year.</p>

<p class="body">While the Nassau grouper is considered nontoxic throughout its range, several
species of grouper (particularly black and red) in the western Atlantic have
been implicated as transmitters of Ciguatera. Ciguatera is a toxic disease often
causing prolonged gastrointestinal, neurological and cardiovascular ailments.
Disease transmission is particularly associated with ingestion of older fish that have
accumulated larger amounts of the toxin (de Sylva and Higman 1980 and Poli 1982
as cited in Jory and Iversen 1989).</p>
