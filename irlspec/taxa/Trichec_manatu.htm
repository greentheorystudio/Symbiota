              and the Antillean manatee (<em>Trichechus manatus manatus</em>)
              based on measurable differences in cranial morphology. They also
              suggested that Florida manatees may be reproductively isolated from
              the Antillean manatee and other Sirenians of the Western Hemisphere
              due to cold winter temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, and the strong

              manatus latirostris</em>, like all Sirenians, are non-ruminant herbivores
              that live in loosely associated social groups (Hartman 1979). The
              body is massive and fusiform, resembling that of a seal. Body color
              is generally light to dark gray or brown. Calves are somewhat darker
              at birth, but lighten gradually within the first month. Adults may
              reach an average of 3 m (9.8 ft.) in length and 1000 kg (2,200 lbs).
              The largest adults grow to 4.6 m (15 ft.) and 1,620 kg (3,570 lbs)
              (Rathbun et al. 1990). Females tend to be larger than males of the
              same age. </font></font></p>
            <p><font color="000080" size="3">Hair is sparse, but distributed all
              over the entire body surface, with stiff whiskers around the face
              and muzzle. The upper lip is flexible and lined with bristles on
              both the upper and lower lip pads. The tail is large, rounded and
              horizontally flattened. No hind limbs are present but forelimbs
              are rounded and paddle-like. Females have 2 mammary glands at the
              axilla of each forelimb. The head is bulbous, with the small eyes
              set widely apart. Eyes close by contraction of a sphincter muscle
              around the eye. Orbits are lined with oil glands that bathe the
              corneas and a nictitating membrane is present. Nostrils are located
              on the dorsal surface of the snout. Ear openings are small, located
              immediately behind the eyes, and lack pinnae (USFWS 2001).</font></p>
            <p><font color="000080" size="3">Bones are massive and heavy, with
              the ribs and long bones of the limbs lacking marrow cavities (O'Dell
              1982). A layer of blubber underlies the skin, and fat deposits are
              found around the intestines and muscles. Molars designed for crushing
              are grown continuously in the posterior portion of the jaw and move
              forward as old teeth wear down (Domning and Hayek 1986). Analysis
              of ear structure suggests that manatee hearing is not acute, and
              they may have difficulty in localizing sound that occurs outside
              of a narrow, low frequency range (Ketten et al. 1992). The brain
              is small in comparison to other similarly sized mammals.</font></p>

              </font></b><font size="3" color="#008080"> <font color="000080">Based
              on highest minimum counts of the manatee population in the United
              States, the Florida manatee (<em>Trichechus manatus latirostris</em>),
              found only in the southeastern U.S., constitutes the largest known
              group of West Indian manatees anywhere within the species' range
              (USFWS 2001). In contrast, the Antillean manatee (<em>T. manatus
              manatus</em>), which occurs in the Greater Antilles, eastern Mexico,
              Central America, north and northeastern South America and Trinidad
              (Lefebvre et al 2001) has a wider distribution area, but significantly
              smaller population sizes. It is suggested that Antillean manatees
              do not achieve larger population sizes because they are subject
              to poaching, incidental take in gillnets, and severe habitat loss
              in many areas within the range (USFWS 2001). </font></font></p>
            <p><font color="000080" size="3">Florida manatees are found only in
              the southeastern U.S., though a few have been documented in the
              Bahamas (Lefebvre et al 2001). When waters are warm, from approximately
              March - late November, some manatees travel along the east coast
              into Georgia, North and South Carolina, Virginia, and occasionally
              further north into New York and even Rhode Island (Deutsch et al.
              2003). On Florida's west coast, some manatees move into Alabama,
              Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas during the spring and summer months
              (Powell and Rathbun 1984). </font></p>
            <p><font color="000080" size="3">During winter months (December -
              February), manatees are temperature-restricted to peninsular Florida,
              and their geographic range constricts to approximately the 20&deg;C
              isotherm, including many warm-water refuge areas around artesian
              springs, power plants, and other industrial sites where thermal
              effluents occur. Natural refuges include Blue Spring, Crystal River,
              Homasassa Spring, and Warm Mineral Spring. Ten major thermal refuges
              around power plants have also been identified, 3 on the west coast,
              and 7 on the east coast (Reynolds and Wilcox 1986, 1994). </font></p>
            <p><font color="000080" size="3">The northern extent of the Florida
              manatee was believed to be south Florida; however, loss of habitat
              in south Florida, coupled with expansion of human population with
              consequent construction of power plants and other industrial sites
              that discharge warm effluents, have caused manatees to expand their
              wintering grounds into previously unsuitable areas.</font></p>
            <p> <font color="000080" size="3">The historical ranges of <em>T.
              m. latirostris</em> and <em>T. m. manatus</em> may overlap along
              the Gulf coast of Texas where strays from Mexico and Florida sometimes
              co-occur (USFWS 2001). </font></p>

              Manatees are distributed throughout the IRL. Historical accounts
              of manatee occurrence and movement suggest that manatees are likely
              to be as geographically widespread as they are at present, but are
              less abundant in many regions (USFWS 2001; Lefebvre et al. 2001),

              timed to coincide with periods of extreme cold weather when manatees

                The Atlantic subpopulation includes all manatees occurring along
                Florida's east coast. During the January 2001 survey, 1447 manatees
                were counted. Data from Craig and Reynolds (2004) was in agreement
                with this estimate, and reported the population size of manatees

                1607 (within a 95% Bayesian credible interval of 1353 - 1972)

                the last 5 years, lower adult survival rates have been observed,
                suggesting that this subpopulation may be declining by approximately

                smaller area, primarily south of Palatka, when winter temperatures
                turn cold. During the 2001 survey, 112 manatees were counted.
                However, observations attempting to identify nearly every individual
                using Blue Spring, the main overwintering site in the region,
                showed that at least 141 different manatees visited the spring
                during winter of 2001. A total of 154 manatees were counted at
                Blue Spring during the most recent synoptic survey in January
                2005 (Haubold et al. 2006).</font></p>

                year. Coupled with the strong growth rate are high adult survival
                and reproductive rates. Thus, the smallest of the four subpopulations,
                accounting for only 5% of the total population, is growing at
                the fastest rate (Haubold et al. 2006).</font></p>

                There is somewhat greater uncertainty about survival and reproductive
                rates in this region, as is reflected by the relatively wide confidence
                interval. This population has lower estimates of adult survival
                than those of all other subpopulations, likely due to the combined
                effects of watercraft mortality and episodic mortality events
                caused by red tide, but possibly also due to the geographic extent
                of current sampling efforts (Haubold et al. 2006). </font></p>

              Stabilization in the water arises from the elongate body shape of
              the manatee, dorsal position of the lungs, and the heavy bones of
              the manatee, which contribute to the animal's neutral buoyancy by
              acting as ballast. Most swimming activity in manatees is accomplished
              solely by dorsoventral undulations of the wide, rounded tail, which
              also serves as a rudder. Manatees are able to steer, bank, and roll
              simply by adjusting tail position. Newborns tend to use the flippers
              exclusively while swimming (Hartman 1979). </font></font></p>
            <p><font color="000080" size="3">Flippers are used primarily for turning,
              but also for precise movements, course corrections, stabilizing
              position, and for orientation while feeding, idling or socializing.
              When idling on the bottom while resting or feeding, the flippers
              provide the sole source of movement, with many manatees using the
              tips of their flippers to balance upon while resting. Manatees have
              often been observed "walking" along the bottom using alternating
              flipper movements (Hartman 1979). </font></p>
            <p><font color="000080" size="3">Swimming speeds in adults are approximately
              18 - 21 strokes per minute while idling; 24 - 36 strokes per minute
              while cruising; and 45 - 50 strokes per minute while escaping. Average
              idling speeds of adults were clocked at approximately 2 - 5 km/hr.
              while idling; 3 - 7 km/hr. while cruising; and 18 - 25 km/hr. in
              flight. Fleeing sprints are generally short in duration, usually
              not more than 100 meters. Calves, being smaller, must stroke at
              a higher rate to keep pace with adults; however, observations show
              that cows tend to swim more slowly when accompanied by calves. (Hartman

              4 weeks with different males cycling in and out of the herd daily
              (Haubold et al. 2006; Rathbun 1999; Rathbun et al. 1995). Hartman
              (1979) observed one estrous herd on Florida's West coast consisting
              of a single female and as many as 17 mature bulls that constantly
              pursued her. Juvenile males in the population joined and exited
              the pursuit at various times as well. Bulls generally are tireless
              while courting a female, constantly embracing or mouthing her as
              she swims. The constant harassment often leads females to swim into
              very shallow water, where they are known to beach themselves to
              avoid the attention of males. Rathbun et al. (1995) suggested that
              older, larger males dominate access to females in mating herds and
              are responsible for the majority of pregnancies. </font></p>

              pregnancy rate). Life tables reported in this study indicated approximately
              zero population growth with a net reproductive rate of 1.09, and
              a finite rate of increase of 0.005, which is not statistically different
              from zero (Marmontel et al. 1997). Further, the authors suggested
              that manatee survival in Florida did not follow the pattern observed
              in other large mammals species, but rather resembled survivorship

              for 6 - 8 hours per day (Best 1981; Hartman 1979). Manatees and
              are apparently unparticular in their choice of feeding sites when
              food is abundant, and will often continue to exploit specific areas
              until food resources are depleted (Best 1981; Hartman 1979).</font></font></p>
            <p><font color="000080">The stomach is small relative to body size.
              A fingerlike projection, called the cardiac gland, protrudes from
              the cardiac portion of the stomach and secretes most enzymes used
              in digestion (Best 1981). Digestive efficiencies in manatees are
              similar to those of terrestrial herbivores such as the horse (Best
              1981). Intestines may measure up to 40 m (130 ft.) in length (Reynolds
              1979).</font></p>
            <p><font color="000080">Manatees feed exclusively on submerged, emergent
              and floating vegetation in freshwater, brackish and marine waters,
              with seagrasses an important staple in the diet (USFWS 2001). They
              are indiscriminate feeders that ingest whatever vegetation is available,
              and move freely between habitats in search of food (Hartman 1979).
              Feeding generally occurs in shallow water 1- 4 m deep. Plants are
              consumed <em>in situ</em> or taken below the surface to be manipulated
              into the mouth using the foreflippers. The upper lips of a manatee
              are bilobed, prehensile, and covered with stiff bristles. To feed,
              the lobes are everted so they project forward to the food source.
              Upon contact with food, Lips then close laterally, the bristles
              grasping the food and tucking it into the mouth (Hartman 1979).</font></p>
            <p><font color="000080">In fresh water, manatees tend to favor submerged,
              vascular plants such as <em>Hydrilla verticilata</em>, <em>Myriophyllum
              spicatum</em>, <em>Ceratophyllum demersum, Vallisneria</em> sp.
              and <em>Callisneria neotropicalis</em> (Snipes 1984; Best 1981).
              In marine and estuarine habitats, algae such as <em>Anabena, Cladophora,
              Enteromorpha, Gracilaria, Oscillatoria</em>, and <em>Spirogyra</em>
              are often consumed, as well as a variety of seagrasses, especially
              <em>Thalassia testudinum</em> (turtle grass) (Best 1981, Hartman
              1979). Provancha and Hall (1991) found spring aggregations of manatees
              feeding in seagrasses dominated by<em> Syringodium filiforme</em>
              (manatee grass) and reported an apparent preference for both <em>Syringodium</em>
              and<em> Halodule wrightii</em> (shoalgrass) over other seagrasses
              and macroalgae such as <em>Caulerpa</em> spp.</font></p>
            <p><font color="000080">Manatees continuously replace worn teeth.
              As anterior-most teeth wear and are lost, replacement teeth grow
              at the posterior end of the tooth row (Best 1981).</font></p>

              Manatees do not strongly compete with other herbivores, likely due
              to their flexibility in making food choices based on availability
              (Best 1981). </font></p>
            <p><font color="#008080"><b>Predators:</b></font><font color="000080" size="3"><br>
              Manatees have few known predators, but all members of the Sirenia
              have been hunted for food (Rathbun 1984; Best 1981; Domning 1978),
              with some populations, especially in the southern hemisphere, still
              noted to be at risk from poaching and subsistence hunting (IUCN
              2006, Jim&eacute;nez 2002; Domning 1982). A related species, Steller's
              sea cow (<em>Hydrodamalis gigas</em>), was a 25-foot kelp-feeder
              that inhabited the Bering Sea. It was hunted to extinction by fur
              seal hunters within 25 years of its discovery in 1741 (Hartman1979;
              Marmontel et al. 1997; Domning 1978). </font></p>
            <p><font color="000080" size="3">In Florida, evidence shows manatees
              were hunted by pre-Columbian societies. After Spanish occupation
              of Florida, the increase in human population increased hunting pressures
              on the manatee, heavily impacting population levels. Commercial
              and subsistence hunting during the 1800s also significantly reduced
              the population in Florida. In 1893, the State of Florida passed
              legislation banning the killing of manatees and they have been protected
              since that time (USFWS 2001). </font></p>

              Manatee skin supports a variety of parasitic or commensal organisms.
              Ectoparasites and commensals include the copepod<em> Harpacticus
              pulex; Lyngbya</em>, a blue-green algae; diatoms, balanid barnacles,
              protozoans, nematodes, isopods, small gastropods, and leeches (Hartman
              1979). Endoparasites include digenetic trematodes and a variety
              of nematodes (Hartman 1979). </font> </p>
            <p><font color="#008080"><b>Habitats:</b><font color="000080" size="3"><br>
              Manatees are habitat generalists that utilize canal systems, mangrove
              creeks, saltmarshes, estuaries, bays and nearshore coastal waters.
              They move freely between habitat types and regularly seek out fresh
              water sources for osmoregulation (Haubold et al. 2006; Lefebvre
              et al. 2001; Hartman 1979). </font></font></p>
            <p><font color="000080" size="3">Manatees typically inhabit waters
              less than 3.7 m (12 feet) in depth (Haubold et al. 2006). Hartman
              (1979) reported manatees in Western Florida generally inhabited
              depths of 1.5 - 2 meters (4.9 - 6.6 feet), and observed that manatees
              tended to avoid waters less than 1.5 m deep unless these areas had
              access to deeper waters nearby. Feeding is sometimes observed on
              grassflats less than 50 cm (19.7 inches.) deep. Estrous females
              often escape the attentions of following males by moving into waters
              as shallow as 60 cm (23.6 inches), with some even stranding themselves
              for brief periods. </font></p>
            <p><font color="000080" size="3">Hartman (1979) reported that fast
              moving currents, generally over 5 km/hr. (3 miles/hr.), discourage
              manatees from occupying certain areas. In Sebastian Inlet, currents
              can exceed 11 km/hr. (6.8 miles/hr.) at certain points during the
              day. These strong currents likely deter manatees from entering or
              exiting the inlet during periods of peak velocity. Rather, manatees
              may swim adjacent to the shoreline, or slip in or out of the Inlet
              during slack tides.</font></p>
            <p><b><font size="3" color="#008080">Activity Time:</font></b><font size="3" color="#008080"><font color="000080"><br>
              Manatees are generally arrhythmic (Hartman 1979), with feeding,
              resting, traveling, socializing, and other activities showing no
              consistent differences between day and evening hours. Feeding occurs
              over 1 - 2 hour periods and totals 6 - 8 hours daily. Socialization
              among manatees is highly variable, but is apparently higher in winter
              when animals aggregate in warm-water refuges. Though manatees spend
              much of their days seeking out food; sleeping, or traveling (Best
              1981), they also spend approximately 6 - 10 hours at rest with no

              growth and adult survival. Habitat loss as the result of unconstrained
              coastal development is a major consideration, as are human-related
              factors such as death due to watercraft collisions, entrapment in
              flood gates and canal locks, entanglement in gear or lines, etc.
              Beyond human-related causes, natural factors such as cold stress,
              depressed rates of survival in young manatees, red tides, and stochastic
              events, all contribute to annual losses to the population that may

              manatee is characterized as a species with a low maximum rate of
              potential increase (USFWS 2001). It is slow to mature, generally
              produces only one offspring per pregnancy, has long periods of offspring
              dependency, and long interbirth periods. Thus, like other large

              of manatee deaths. USFWS (2001) reported a 6.0% annual increase
              in manatee deaths between 1976 - 2000. Note that 1996 was

              Because the manatee is slow to mature and has a low reproductive
              capacity, population stability and growth are linked closely to
              adult survival rates. Marmontel et al. (1997) reported that
              manatee survivorship curves resembled those of exploited populations
              and explained this observation as being due primarily to human-related
              causes that account for 30% or more of total documented mortality
              annually. Watercraft collisions alone account for 25% of annual
              mortality (FWRI 2006; Haubold et al 2006; FFWCC 2003;
              USFWS 2001; Marmontel et al 1997) and approximately 3.5 - 5.3% of
              the annual observed total population (Haubold et al. 2006).
              Many researchers (Haubold et al. 2006; USFWS 2001; Marmontel et
              al. 1997; Wright et al. 1995) have emphasized that besides habitat
              protection, population stability and growth can be achieved by reducing
              watercraft-related deaths. However, all indicators show that
              on an annual basis, there is likely to be even greater watercraft
              pressure on manatee populations as Florida's human population grows
              and the number of watercraft increases.  <br>

              Net immigration of new permanent residents to Florida is approximately
              760 persons per day, with 80% of immigrants choosing to settle within
              16 km (7 miles) of a coast (Bureau of Economics and Business Research
              1993). Haubold et al. (2006) noted that by 2004, the number of registered
              boats in Florida had doubled since 1980 to over 982,000, excluding
              those that are brought to Florida by seasonal visitors and tourists.
              As of December, 2005, the number of registered vessels in all size
              classes in Florida was 1,010,370 (FDHSMV 2005), approximately 1
              vessel for every 17 persons. Wright et al. (1995) projected that
              this number is expected to increase by approximately 2.9% each year,
              and will continue to increase in concert with increases in Florida's
              human population. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="000080" size="3">Ackerman et al. (1995)
              reported that boating-related mortality in manatees increased by
              10.3% annually since 1976. Additionally, the sub-lethal effects
              of watercraft collisions are also cause for alarm. Based on a photo
              identification database, more than 1000 Florida manatees are documented
              to have at least one healed scar caused by a boat strike. Moreover,
              97% of manatees in this sample bear scars from multiple collisions
              (O'shea et al. 2001; Wright et al 1995; Beck and Reid 1995). </font></p>

              Marmontel et al. (1997) stressed that manatee management and recovery
              efforts must focus on retaining and improving the conditions under
              which manatee demography operates, with research and management

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;USFWS: <br>
              </strong><em>Trichechus manatus latirostris</em> is Federally listed
              as an Endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973,
              and was downlisted in Florida to Threatened status as of June 7,
              2006. </font></span></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="000080">The most significant and controllable
              threat to manatee recovery remains human-related mortality, specifically
              boat strikes that cause death or debilitating injury (USFWS 2001).
              As a result, the challenge for managers has increasingly become
              how to modify human, not manatee, behavior (Reynolds 1999).&nbsp;</font><font color="000080">The
              USFWS and FFWCC will both continue to evaluate needs for additional
              protection areas that may be necessary to achieve manatee recovery,
              with the goal of considering manatee needs at the ecosystem-level,
              thus assuring that protection regulations as well as quality and
              quantity of habitat are sufficient to ensure recovery of the species.
               </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="000080">Recently, both the USFWS and
              FFWCC have used targeted enforcement strategies in an attempt to
              increase boater compliance with manatee protection areas and slow-speed
              zones, which ultimately will reduce manatee injuries and deaths.
               Current priority actions in manatee conservation and protection
              include improved boater education, increased enforcement of existing
              regulations, improved maintenance of signs and buoys, compliance
              assessment, and periodic re-evaluation of the effectiveness of the
              rules. However, increased protection and enforcement efforts
              have generally met with vehement opposition by recreational boaters,
              boat manufacturers, legislators, and development interests throughout
              the State.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="000080">Another significant problem for
              managers is the insuring the stability and longevity of warm-water
              winter refuges. Historically, manatees relied on warm temperate
              waters of south Florida and on natural warm-water springs throughout
              their range as winter refuges. However, with the increased
              construction of power plants and other industrial plants discharging
              thermal effluents, manatees expanded their winter ranges to include
              these sites as well. Currently, approximately 66% of the total
              manatee population relies on industrial sites for winter refuge
              from cold waters. Should the stability of these sites come
              into question, as could occur as the power industry continues to
              deregulate, then manatees in these areas could become vulnerable
              to escalating mortality rates.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="000080">Intensive coastal development
              throughout Florida poses an additional long-term threat to the Florida
              manatee (USFWS 2001). There are three major approaches to address
              this problem. First, the USFWS, and the state agencies of Florida,
              Georgia, and the Gulf States, as well as other regional recovery
              partners continue to review and comment on permit applications for
              construction projects that could occur in manatee habitat areas
              so that detrimental impacts can be minimized. Second, coastal
              counties in Florida have been required to develop their own plans
              for manatee protection. Third, habitat protection is being accomplished
              through land acquisition. Both the USFWS and the State of Florida
              have taken steps to acquire new areas of critical manatee habitat
              for protected areas. The State of Florida has acquired important
              areas through several programs, most notably the Florida Forever
              Program (USFWS 2001).</font></p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font color="000080">The USFWS
              Manatee Recovery Plan (2001) sets the long-term goals of </font></span>
              <font color="000080">minimizing the causes of manatee disturbance,
              harassment, injury and death; determining and monitoring the
              status of the manatee population; identification, protection, evaluation
              and monitoring of critical manatee habitats; facilitation of manatee
              recovery efforts through improved public awareness and education.
              There are also threats from natural events such as red tides and
              cold events that may require additional efforts. It is anticipated
              that full recovery may not be possible for another 14 years or more.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font color="000080">Federal downlisting of the manatee will occur
              when the following conditions are met:</font></p>
            <p><font color="000080">1. Threats to manatee habitat or range,
              as well as threats from <br>

              minimum spring flows <br>

              foraging habitats are <br>

              In Florida, new criteria for evaluating imperiled species were implemented
              in 2005. Under this new process, imperiled species must qualify
              under at least one of the criteria listed in Table 5 below:</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font color="000080" size="3">In August 2001, the

              Wildlife Conservation Commission to assess the Endangered status
              of <em>Trichechus manatus latirostris</em> with a view to delisting
              it as an endangered species. Manatee status was reviewed, but in
              December 2003, FFWCC postponed most listing decisions to re-evaluate
              the listing process. This new process was adopted in April 2005,
              and the manatee was reviewed under the criteria for this new process.
              </font></p>
            <p><font color="000080" size="3">It was found that though manatee
              numbers appear to have risen over the last several decades, many
              human-related (habitat loss, coastal development, watercraft-related
              mortality) and natural threats (uncertainty of future warm-water
              refuges, red tide events, hurricanes and other stochastic events)
              to the population remained. </font></p>
            <p><font color="000080" size="3">Under Criterion A, which addresses population
              reduction, it was found that the manatee had a 12.1% probability
              of a 50% population reduction within 3 generations; and a 46.5%
              probability of a 30% population reduction in 3 generations. It thus
              qualified as a Threatened species under Criterion A.</font></p>
            <p><font color="000080" size="3">Criterion B concerns the extent of
              occurrence and area of occupancy. It was found that the extent of
              manatee occurrence is approximately 7500 square miles, with an area
              of occupancy of 100 - 300 square miles. Manatees met the condition
              of a decline in area of occupancy, but the Biological Review Committee
              did not feel that manatees occur only in a limited number of locations,
              nor was their habitat severely fragmented. Hence, manatees did not
              qualify under Criterion B.</font></p>
            <p><font color="000080" size="3">Criterion C addresses population size and
              population trends. The total minimum population size for the manatee
              was calculated to be 2,310 adults, with no evidence of extreme fluctuation
              in population numbers, and no subpopulation contained greater than
              90% of the total population. However, the probability of a 20% reduction
              in population size within 2 generations was calculated to be 55.5%;
              and there was a 77.1% probability of a 10% population reduction.
              Manatees thus qualified as Threatened under Criterion C.</font></p>
            <p><font color="000080" size="3">Criterion D concerns the number of
              mature individuals in the population. With a minimum adult population
              size of 2, 310, and an area of occupancy of 100 - 300 square miles,
              the manatee did not qualify under Criterion D.</font></p>
            <p><font color="000080" size="3">Criterion E addresses the probability of imminent
              extinction. It was calculated that manatees had an overall probability
              of extinction in the next 100 years of only 1%. Further, the total
              population is not likely to approach any of the qualifying thresholds
              outlined in the listing criteria; though one of the 4 subpopulations
              would qualify for listing if the subpopulations were considered
              separately. Thus, manatees did not meet the listing qualifications
              under Criterion E.</font></p>
