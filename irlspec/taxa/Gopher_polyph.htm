    <p class="body"><b>Subphylum</b>: Vertebrata</p>

   	  <p class="title">Species Description</p>
    <p class="body">The gopher tortoise, <i>Gopherus polyphemus</i>,
    is a large terrestrial turtle having forefeet well adapted for burrowing,
    and elephantine hind feet. The front legs have scales to protect the
    tortoise while burrowing. Body length averages approximately 25 cm (10
    inches), with the shell ranging in height from 15 - 37 cm (6 - 15
    inches). Body mass averages approximately 4 kg (9 pounds). Color is a dark
    brown to gray-black, with a yellow plastron (bottom shell). A gular
    projection is evident on the anterior plastron where the head projects out
    from the shell. Sexual dimorphism is evident, with male gopher tortoises
    having concave plastrons, while those of females are flat. In addition, the
    gular projection on male plastrons is generally longer than in females
    (Ernst and Barbour 1972).</p>
    <p class="body">Gopher tortoises dig burrows for cover and for
    nesting. These can be extensive, measuring approximately 4.7 - 11 m (14 -
    40 feet) in length (Witz et al. 1991). Burrow depth is heavily dependent on
    depth of the local water table (Diemer 1986; Burke and Cox 1988).</p>
    	  </li>
  <li>
  	<p class="heading">HABITAT AND DISTRIBUTION</p>
    <p class="title">Regional Occurrence</p>
<p class="body">The distribution of gopher tortoise is generally correlated with the original
range of longleaf pine forests according to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
estimates (USFWS 1990). Along the Atlantic coast, <i>G. polyphemus</i> occurs
from southern South Carolina, through Georgia and Florida. Beyond this area of
the range, disjunct populations occur westward through southeastern Louisiana.
The segment of the population that occurs westward from the Tombigbee and Mobile
Rivers in Alabama is federally listed as threatened.</p>

<p class="title">IRL Distribution</p>
<p class="body">Gopher tortoises are found in all counties in Florida and utilize many habitat
types, from beach dunes to scrub and pine flatwoods. Though it is generally
agreed that typical gopher tortoise habitats are sandy and well-drained,
Breininger et al. (1991) observed that in Brevard County, Florida, gopher
tortoises often inhabit poorly-drained scrub and slash pine areas. The
Breininger et al. (1991) study reported higher overall tortoise densities in
poorly-drained areas than in well-drained, sandy areas.</p>
</li>
   <li>
   		<p class="heading">LIFE HISTORY AND POPULATION BIOLOGY</p>
      <p class="title">Age, Size, Lifespan</p>
<p class="body">Body length averages 25 cm (10 inches); shell height ranges from 15 - 37 cm (6
- 15 inches); body mass averages 4 kg (9 pounds). <i>G. polyphemus</i> can be
long-lived. Age estimates for tortoises in the wild ranges from 40 - 60 years;
however, captive tortoises can live more than 100 years (Landers et al. 1980).</p>

<p class="title">Abundance</p>
<p class="body">The gopher tortoise is listed in Florida as a Species of Special Concern (SSC).
Auffenberg and Franz (1982) have estimated that historical population densities
of this species had been reduced 70% by the year 2000, and could be extirpated
from all but protected land areas by 2025. Merritt Island Wildlife Refuge at
Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida is the largest protected area of gopher
tortoise habitat along the Atlantic coast. Overall tortoise density at KSC is
estimated at approximately 18,000 animals, with tortoise density highest in
areas where herbaceous cover dominates. Tortoise density decreases in areas
where cover of shrubs, oak trees and pines dominates (Breininger et al. 1988,
1991, 1994).</p>

<p class="title">Locomotion</p>
<p class="body">Gopher tortoises walk and burrow.</p>

<p class="title">Reproduction</p>
<p class="body">Maturity is reached at 19 - 21 years of age in Georgia, 10 - 15 years in
Florida. The reproductive season extends from February through September, with a
peak throughout May and June (Diemer 1986). Females excavate nests in open,
sandy areas. One clutch of eggs is laid per year, with an average of 6 eggs laid
each season. However, clutch size varies depending on body size, and ranges
anywhere between 3 - 14 eggs. Females may have only one successful brood every
ten years, as most eggs do not survive to hatching. Mammalian predators such as
foxes, raccoons, feral cats, and armadillos prey upon eggs. Landers et al.
(1980) estimated that only 1 - 3 eggs of every 100 eggs survives to maturity.</p>

<p class="title">Embryology</p>
<p class="body">Incubation time is approximately 100 days in Georgia, and 80 - 90 days in
Florida. Sex of hatchlings is dependent on the temperature of the sand where the
nest is sited. In gopher tortoises, average sand temperatures above 30&deg;C (approximately 85&deg; F) produce females, while those
below 30&deg; C produce males.</p>
<p class="body">Hatchlings measure approximately 3 - 5 cm (1.5 - 2 in.) long and are
vulnerable to predation due to their soft shells. Growth rates in gopher
tortoises are extremely slow, estimated to be less than 2.5 cm (1 in.) per year.</p>
</li>
   <li>
   	<p class="heading">PHYSICAL TOLERANCES</p>
    <p class="title">Temperature</p>
<p class="body">Gopher tortoises are cold sensitive (Auffenberg and Franz 1982; Diemer 1986).</p>

<p class="title">Physical Tolerances</p>
<p class="body"><b>Disease:</b> Gopher tortoises are susceptible to a disease called Upper Respiratory
Tract Disease (URTD). This disease is caused by the bacterium <i>Mycoplasma
agassizii</i> and is not only extremely contagious, but generally fatal once
contracted. URTD was first discovered in 1991at Sanibel Island, Florida, and
has subsequently been found throughout the tortoise's range. URTD inflames
the respiratory tract of tortoises, causing wheezing, swollen eyelids, and
excessive mucous. Infected animals, unable to find food or eat, eventually
die. The disease is spread by introduction of sick animals into healthy
populations. Urban development and habitat fragmentation contribute to
infection by forcing tortoise populations closer together in suitable
habitats.</p>
</li>
   <li>
   	<p class="heading">COMMUNITY ECOLOGY</p>
	<p class="title">Trophic Mode</p>
<p class="body">Gopher tortoises are primarily herbivorous, with
the bulk of the diet consisting of low-growing herbs and grasses. Foods most
common in the diet are grasses and legume fruits. They are also known to consume
pine needles and seeds, oak mast, prickly pear cactus, asters, palm tree fruits,
raspberries, black cherry, and gopher apples (Landers et al. 1980; Auffenberg
and Franz 1982; Diemer 1986). Gopher tortoises have also been observed to eat
mollusk shells and the bones of dead animals, possibly to supplement their diets
with additional calcium.</p>

<p class="title">Competitors</p>
<p class="body">Predators of gopher tortoises include various
snakes, fire ants (<i>Solenopsis saevissima</i>), accipiter hawks, buteo hawks,
raccoons, opossums, armadillos, skunks, dogs, foxes, feral cats and man all prey
on gopher tortoises. Generally, eggs and hatchling tortoises are significantly
more at risk for predation than older animals.</p>

<p class="title">Habitats</p>
<p class="body">Gopher tortoises use a variety of habitats,
including beach dunes, scrub, and pine flatwoods. In all habitat types, soils
are generally dry, sandy and well-drained. While generally avoiding swampy
areas, gopher tortoises in Brevard County, Florida have been observed to inhabit
poorly-drained scrub and slash pine flatwoods (Breininger et al., 1991). In this
county, higher densities of gopher tortoises were found in poorly-drained sites
than in well-drained sites.</p>
<p class="body">Individuals occupy distinct home ranges, with male home
ranges typically being larger than those of females. In east-central Florida,
home ranges of male tortoises averaged 1.9 ha (4.7 ac), while those of females
averaged only 0.65 ha (1.6 ac). A tortoise excavates several burrows for its use
within the home range. Burrows typically are dug at a 30&deg;
angle from the surface. In Florida studies, male tortoises dug between 8 - 35
burrows. Females tended not to use as many burrows as males, averaging between 3
- 17 burrows (Breininger et al., 1988).</p>
<p class="body">Tortoise densities tend to be higher in fire-adapted
communities (Auffenberg and Franz 1982; Diemer 1986). In the absence of fire,
canopy trees grow large and shade out the herbaceous vegetation that gopher
tortoises rely on as their primary food source.</p>

<p class="title">Associated Species</p>
<p class="body"><i>Gopherus polyphemus</i> is considered a keystone
species in that more than 80 different species live in their burrows, or are
dependent on their burrows for protection. Some of these species, such as the
gopher frog (<i>Rana areolata</i>), the pine snake (<i>Pituophis melanoleucus</i>)
the indigo snake (<i>Dymarchon corais</i>), the scrub jay (<i>Aphelocoma
coerulescens</i>) and in inland prairies, the burrowing owl (<i>Athene
cunicularia floridana</i>) are rare (Burke and Cox 1988; Spillers and Speake
1988; Stout et al. 1988;Witz et al. 1991).</p>
   </li>

   <li>
     <p class="heading">ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>
     <p class="title">Special Status</p>
<p class="body">Gopher tortoises play an important role in
structuring the habitats within ecosystems. They are Federally listed as
threatened in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. In Florida, they are listed
as a Species of Special Concern (SSC).</p>

<p class="title">Benefit in IRL</p>
<p class="body">Gopher tortoises play an important role in
ecosystem ecology for two reasons. First, by consuming grasses, herbs, and the
fruits of trees, the gopher tortoise aids in seed dispersal. Second, its burrows
provide important habitat for more than 80 different species of invertebrates
and vertebrates, some of which are rare.</p>
