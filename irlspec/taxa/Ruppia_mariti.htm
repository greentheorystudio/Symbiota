worldwide, occurring in both temperate and subtropical estuaries, bays and
lagoons (Eiseman 1980). <i> Ruppia maritima</i> occurs in brackish waters along the U.
S. Atlantic coast as well as in alkaline lakes, ponds and streams in the western
U.S. (Phillips 1960). <i> R. maritima</i> has also been reported from Newfoundland
(Fernald
and Wiegand 1914 as cited in Phillips 1960). Phillips (1960) reported the
occurrence of <i> Ruppia</i> at several brackish water sites along the west coast of
Florida. Thorne (1954) ( as cited in Phillips 1960) reported <i> Ruppia maritima</i>
occurring from Bay County Florida to Aransas County Texas. Phillips (1960)
concludes that it is probable that <i> Ruppia</i> occurs from Newfoundland to Texas.</font></p>

Ruppia maritima</i> grows patchily throughout the Indian River Lagoon in very shallow
water, often mixed with <i> Halodule wrightii</i>, and becoming less common in the south
(Virnstein 1995). Eiseman (1980) described the occurrence of <i> Ruppia maritima</i>
throughout the Indian River Lagoon as being sparse, mixed with <i> Halodule 
beaudettei</i>,
and occurring just below the <a href="#intertidal" onClick="popDef('Shore zone delineated by the points of the highest and lowest tidal levels', '#intertidal');" name="intertidal">intertidal</a> zone</a>. Early reports of <i> Ruppia</i> occurring
in the Indian River Lagoon, included several locations in Brevard County
including Sebastian Inlet, as well as from the St. Lucie River near St. Lucie
Inlet (Woodburn and Ingle 1959).</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#000080">Seven species of seagrass,
including all 6 species occurring throughout the tropical western hemisphere, as
well as <i> Halophila johnsonii</i>, known only from coastal lagoons of eastern Florida,
occur in the IRL. <i> Halodule wrightii</i> is the most common. <i> Ruppia maritima</i> is the
least common and is found in the most shallow areas of the lagoon. <i> Syringodium
filiforme</i> can be locally more abundant than <i> H. beaudettei. Thalassia testudinum</i>
occurs in the southern portion of the IRL (Sebastian Inlet and south). <i> Halophila
decipiens, Halophila engelmannii </i> and<i> Halophila johnsonii</i> can form mixed or
monotypic beds with other species. Because of their abundance in deeper water
and high productivity, the distribution and ecological significance of the 3 <i>
Halophila</i> species may have previously been underestimated (Dawes et al 1995).</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#000080">The northern area of the Indian
River Lagoon supports the most developed seagrass beds, presumably because of
relatively low levels of urbanization and fresh water inputs. Four species of
seagrass - <i> Halodule wrightii, Syringodium filiforme, Halophila engelmannii </i> and
<i>
Ruppia maritima</i> - can be found north of Sebastian Inlet, while all 7 species
occur to the south (Dawes et al 1995). Seagrasses were ranked in order of
decreasing percent cover by Virnstein and Cairns (1986) as follows: <i> Syringodium
filiforme, Halodule wrightii, Halophila johnsonii, Thalassia testudinum,
Halophila decipiens, Halophila engelmannii</i> and <i> Ruppia maritima</i>.</font></p>

</font></font><font color="#000080" size="3">
Changes in seagrass distribution and diversity pattern in the Indian River
Lagoon (1940 - 1992) are discussed by Fletcher and Fletcher (1995). It was
estimated that seagrass abundance is 11 % less in 1992 than in the 1970's and 16
% less than in 1986 for the entire Indian River Lagoon complex (Ponce to Jupiter
Inlet). Decreases in abundance occurred particularly north of Vero Beach. In
this area of the lagoon, it was also estimated that maximum depth of seagrass
distribution has decreased by as much as 50 % from 1943 to 1992. Alteration of
such factors as water clarity, salinity and temperature could affect the
diversity and balance of seagrasses in the Indian River Lagoon system and should
be considered when developing management strategies for this resource (Fletcher
&amp; Fletcher 1995).</font></p>

</font></b><font size="3" color="#000080">Seasonality of both growth and
biomass is exhibited by all species of seagrass in the Indian River Lagoon, being maximum during
April to May and June to July respectively.</font></p>
<p><i><font size="3" color="#000080">Ruppia maritima</font></i><font size="3" color="#000080"> is the only
seagrass in the southeastern U. S. that exhibits hydroanemophilous pollination,
i.e., hydrophobic pollen grains float on the water surface. This allows for
either self fertilization or outcross fertilization (Moffler &amp; Durako 1987).</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#000080">Both sexual and vegetative
reproduction can account for new plant production in <i> Ruppia maritima</i>. Dense mats
of flowering Ruppia plants, 2 &amp; 1/2 to 3 feet long, with most plants bearing
flowers, have been observed (Phillips 1960). Muenscher (1944 as cited in
Phillips 1960) described the flowers of <i> Ruppia maritima</i>. Phillips (1960)
reported no correlation between salinity and flowering in <i>Ruppia</i>, although he
reported observing <i> Ruppia</i> before, during and after flowering at salinities above
31.4 <a href="#ppt" onClick="popDef('Parts per thousand', '#ppt');" name="ppt">ppt</a>. An earlier report (Bourn 1935 as cited in Phillips) indicated that <i>
Ruppia</i> needed a salinity of 28.0 ppt or less to set seed. Water temperature, moreso than <a href="#photoperiod" onClick="popDef('The light phase of a light-dark cycle of plant growth', '#photoperiod');" name="photoperiod">photoperiod</a>, appears to be more influential in controlling floral
development as well as subsequent flower density and seed production in
seagrasses. Laboratory experiments showing flowering induction under continuous
light suggests that photoperiod probably plays a limited role in sexual
reproduction (McMillan 1982; Moffler &amp; Durako 1987). Temperatures averaging
22.0 - 24.0&nbsp;&deg;C induced both flowering and fruiting in <i> Ruppia maritima</i>. It was
concluded that a temperature of 15.0 - 20.0&nbsp;&deg;C was required for germination and
seed maturation, while a range of 20.0 - 25.0 &deg;C was necessary for vegetative
growth and reproduction. <i> Ruppia</i> seeds might remain dormant throughout the autumn
and winter and germinate the following spring (Setchell 1924 as cited in
Phillips 1960). It appears that vegetative growth and sexual reproduction
(flowering and fruiting) commence with warm water temperatures in the spring and
end when high summer temperatures persist (Phillips 1960).</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#000080">Because <i> R. maritima</i> flowers so
profusely, its geographical distribution is probably due to sexual reproductive
activity (Phillips 1960, McMillan &amp; Moseley 1967) with fruits/seeds being
dispersed by currents. Seed dispersal could also be accomplished by migratory
waterfowl that use <i> Ruppia</i> as a food source. Vegetative growth as well as sexual
reproductive activity probably serve to maintain and enlarge established beds of
<i>Ruppia</i>.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#000080">Growth of <i> Ruppia maritima,
Halodule wrightii, Halophila engelmannii, Syringodium filiforme</i> and <i> Thalassia
testudinum</i> was investigated at various light intensities in the laboratory.
Optimum growth for all five species was obtained at light intensities of 200 -
450 foot-candles. At light intensities above or below this range, growth was
much slower for all species (Koch et al 1974).</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#000080">Flowering and reproduction of 5
seagrasses including <i> Ruppia maritima</i> was compared between clones placed in
laboratory culture under controlled conditions of light, salinity and
temperature, with those occurring in Redfish Bay, Texas. <i> Ruppia</i> could not be
induced to produce flowers in the laboratory although it flowered in Redfish Bay
sporadically throughout the summer. In this study <i> Halophila engelmannii</i> produced
flowers continuously in the laboratory (January - September), as well as in the
field (April - mid-June) implying that conditions inducing flowering in <i>
Halophila</i> do not affect <i> Ruppia</i> in the same manner (McMillan 1976). <i> Ruppia
maritima</i> occurs occasionally in the intertidal zone but probably does not flower
there (Phillips 1960).</font></p>

Fl where temperatures ranged from 13.0 - 35.0 &deg;C and survived extremes of 7.0

water temperatures in the spring, and are most abundant during the flowering

aquatic plants, <i> Ruppia </i> and <i> Thalassia</i> contain substantial amounts of protein,
carbohydrate, energy and minerals, but that nutritional value of these plants

Along the Gulf coast, the predominant substratum where
<i> Ruppia
maritima</i> occurred, was a mixture of mud and silt with fine textured sand. All
seagrasses, including <i>Ruppia</i>, aid in binding sediment and thereby lessen the
effects of erosion (Phillips 1960).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><i><font size="3">Ruppia maritima</font></i><font size="3"> appears to prefer
brackish water less than 25.0 ppt salinity. In Florida, <i> Ruppia</i> was found from
the intertidal to a depth of 7 feet, with densest growth at 2 to 4 feet (mean
high tide). Phillips (1960) speculated that the restriction of <i> Ruppia</i> to shallow
water is a result of its tolerance to low salinity waters, usually occurring in
turbid bays and estuaries. Light penetration is compromised in these turbid
waters and hence will not support plant growth below certain depths.</font></font></p>

Virnstein (1995) suggested the &quot;overlap vs. gap hypothesis&quot; to explain
the unexpectedly high (e.g., fish) or low (e.g., amphipods) diversity of certain
taxa associated with seagrass beds. In a highly variable environment such as the
Indian River Lagoon, diversity of a particular taxa is related to its dispersal
capabilities. For example, amphipods, lacking a <a href="#planktonic" onClick="popDef('Refers to tiny plants and animals suspended in the water column;  zooplankton and phytoplankton', '#planktonic');" name="planktonic">planktonic</a> phase, have limited
recruitment and dispersal capabilities, whereas highly mobile taxa such as fish

preservation of seagrass acreage but more importantly, the number of species of
seagrass within an appropriate area. By maintaining seagrass habitat diversity,
the maintenance of the diverse assemblage of amphipods, mollusks, isopods and
fish, associated with seagrass beds, will be accomplished (Virnstein 1995).</font></p>
