  <p class="title">Species Description</p> 
<p class="body"><i>P. lethostigma</i> is one member of a large family of distinctive <a href="#benthic" onClick="popDef('describes organisms living in or on lakebeds, riverbeds or the seafloor', '#benthic');" name="benthic">benthic</a> flatfishes that inhabit continental shore waters in the tropical and temperate
zones of the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. Flatfishes such as the flounders are unlike most other fishes in that they begin life as <a href="#bilateral" onClick="popDef('Possessing a body plan built around a central longitudinal axis that divides the body into equal right and left sides', '#bilateral');" name="bilateral">bilateral</a> animals, having equal right and left sides, and swim as do other fishes.
However, toward the end of the larval period, flatfishes settle to the <a href="#benthos" onClick="popDef('The bottom of a lakebed, riverbed or the seafloor', '#benthos');" name="benthos">benthos</a> and take up a <a href="#cryptic" onClick="popDef('Refers to the use of coloration and markings that allow an organism to blend in with its environment, thus concealing it from potential predators', '#cryptic');" name="cryptic">cryptic</a>, somewhat sedentary lifestyle, lying on one side of the
body, and swimming laterally to the substratum. <a href="#Metamorphosis" onClick="popDef('The structural and physiological transformation of a developing organism from the larval to the adult body form', '#Metamorphosis');" name="Metamorphosis">Metamorphosis</a> to the juvenile
stage involves complex modification of the skeletal structure of the head, and
rearrangement of the nervous system and muscle tissues. Additionally, the eye on
the side which faces the substratum (termed the blind-side eye) begins to
migrate to the upper side of the body. <i>P. lethostigma</i> is a left-eye
flounder, thus it lies on its right side, and at metamorphosis, the right eye
migrates to the left side of the head. Lefteye flounders sometimes exhibit
<a href="#sexual dimorphism" onClick="popDef('Differences in physical characteristics between males and females within a species', '#sexual dimorphism');" name="sexual dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a>, with females having eyes that are closer together than in
males, and males having somewhat longer pectoral fins (Rogers and Van Den Avyle
1983).</p>

<p class="body">Body color is light to dark brown with diffuse non-ocellated dark spots and
blotches.  The blindside is white or dusky.  <i>P. lethostigma</i> are

  <p class="title">Potentially Misidentified Species</p>
<p class="body"><i>Paralichthys lethostigma</i> is sometimes
confused with <i>P. albigutta</i>, the gulf flounder. The two are easily
distinguished based on the much smaller size of the gulf flounder, which grows
only to 15 inches (38 cm). Additionally, the gulf flounder has 3 ocellated
spots: 2 vertically placed posterior to the pectoral fins, and 1 placed inside
the base of the tail.</p>

   <li>
   		<p class="heading">LIFE HISTORY AND POPULATION BIOLOGY</p>
      <p class="title">Age, Size, Lifespan</p>
  <p class="body">Southern flounder attain a size of up to 3
  feet (91 cm) in length, and can weigh as much as 9 kg (24.1 lbs.) (Smith et
  al. 1999). The von Bertalanffy growth model predicts a maximum age for summer
  flounder of approximately of 20 years (Reagan and Wingo 1985).</p>
  <p class="title">Abundance</p>
  <p class="body"><i>P. lethostigma</i> is one of the largest
  and most commercially valuable flounders in the western North Atlantic (Burke
  et al. 1991).</p>
  
  <p class="title">Reproduction</p>
  <p class="body">Adults migrate to offshore spawning grounds
  during late fall and winter, though some remain in estuaries year-round.
  Spawning migrations are usually preceded by a drop in water temperature of
  4 - 5 &deg;C. Males move
  seaward earlier than females, with few remaining in estuaries after November
  (Reagan and Wingo 1985). In North Carolina, southern flounders begin migration
  in the fall; in Texas, they migrate from October through December (Reagan and
  Wingo 1985).</p>
  <p class="body">Laboratory experiments from Texas indicate that
  approximately 3 weeks before spawning takes place, male southern flounder
  begin following gravid females. In tank experiments, the first spawning was in
  December and occurred at midday. Females swam to the surface and released eggs
  that were immediately fertilized by attending males. Fertilization was 30% to
  50% successful, and 6% to 35% of the eggs hatched within 61 - 76 hr (Reagan
  and Wingo 1985).</p>
  <p class="body">Females become sexually mature at 2 years of age in
  Texas, while the youngest mature female southern flounder in northern Florida
  was 4 years old (Reagan and Wingo 1985).</p>
  <p class="body">Thirteen southern flounders examined in the
  laboratory, produced a total of 120,000 eggs (approximately 9,230 eggs per
  female) (Reagan and Wingo 1985).</p>
  <p class="title">Embryology</p>
  <p class="body">Eggs of <i>P. lethostigma</i> range from 0.85
  - 0.95 mm in diameter (Powell and Henley 1995), with a single oil globule.
  Laboratory rearing of southern flounder shows that eggs hatch after 3 days at
  18&deg;C and 30&permil; salinity (Denson and
  Smith 1997). Larvae begin to feed when 4 -6 days old, and show signs of
  becoming premetamorphic by day 14. By day 16, larvae begin to settle out of
  the water column and congregate on the bottom. By day 21, larvae show signs of
  adult pigmentation, and begin to rest on their left sides, though their eyes
  remain in position. By day 23, metamorphosis is initiated and the left eye
  begins to migrate to the right side. Most animals had completed metamorphosis
  by day 36 (Denson and Smith 1997). In culture experiments, yolk-sac larvae
  began metamorphosing to postlarvae at 40 - 46 days, when they were
  approximately 8  - 11 mm in length. Metamorphosis to the
  juvenile stage was complete by 50 - 51 days (Reagan and Wingo 1985). Data from
  Powell and Henley (1995) show that larvae complete metamorphosis when they
  reach approximately 8.7 - 9.0 mm SL. By this time, the migrating eye has
  reached the dorsal midline, and the larval stage is complete.</p>
  <p class="body">Powell and Henley (1995) examined egg and larval
  development in both <i>P. lethostigma</i> and <i>P. albigutta</i>. Results
  from their study show that fins begin to develop when larvae reach
  approximately 5.4 mm <a href="#notochord" onClick="popDef('A supporting rod whose presence is diagnostic for members of the chordate phylum', '#notochord');" name="notochord">notochord</a> length (NL). The dorsal fin is generally the
  first to begin development, followed by the caudal, anal, pelvic, and pectoral
  fins (Powell and Henley 1995). Development of the caudal fin in <i>P.
  lethostigma</i> can begin when larvae are approximately 5.5 mm NL, but fin
  rays are not observed until larvae attain 8.2 mm SL. Dorsal fins begin to
  develop when larvae are in the preflexion stage, at approximately 6.5 mm NL.
  The dorsal fin is first observed in the head region, with development
  proceeding posteriorly. By the time larvae reach 8.4 mm <a href="#standard length" onClick="popDef('Length of a fish as measured from the front of the upper lip to the end of the vertebral column', '#standard length');" Name="standard length">standard length</a> (SL)
  the dorsal fin is fully developed. Following <a href="#postflexion" onClick="popDef('Developmental stage in larval fish typified by the notochord flexing upwards;  the last stage before metamorphosis to the juvenile stage', '#postflexion');" name="postflexion">postflexion</a>, when larvae reach
  approximately 7.3 mm standard length (SL), anal fin rays begin to develop,
  with the full adult complement of fin rays reached at a body size of 8.4 mm
  SL. Pelvic fins are first observed on larvae at approximately 8.2 mm SL, and
  are fully developed by the time larvae attain 9.7 mm SL. Pectoral fins first
  begin formation when larvae are approximately 8.4 mm SL, and are fully formed
  when larvae exceed 11.0 mm SL.</p>
  <p class="body">Pigmentation is first observed in middle-stage eggs,
  following <a href="#blastopore" onClick="popDef('Invagination of the early blastula that forms either the mouth or anus of the developing embryo', '#blastopore');" name="blastopore">blastopore</a> closure. In larvae, pigmentation is more pronounced in
  the caudal area, being less developed overall in <i>P. lethostigma</i> than in
  its close relative <i>P. albigutta</i>, the gulf flounder (Powell and Henley
  1995).</p>
  <p class="body">Larvae spawned offshore in the Atlantic Ocean make
  their return to estuarine habitats by passive transport on nearshore and tidal
  currents from November through April, with a peak in recruitment occurring in
  February (Burke et al. 1991). In the gulf of Mexico, Southern flounder
  postlarvae are caught along the Gulf of Mexico coast during winter and early
  spring. At Galveston Island, Texas, southern flounder postlarvae
  18 - 34 mm in total length (TL) were captured during February,
  March, and May. Fish 25 - 51 mm TL were caught in the Mississippi River during
  the spring. In Aransas Bay, Texas, the peak movement of postlarvae flounders
  into estuaries is in February, when water temperature is 16.0 - 16.2 &deg;C (Stokes 1977).</p>

   <li>
   	<p class="heading">PHYSICAL TOLERANCES</p>
    <p class="title">Temperature</p>
  <p class="body">Temperature influences the migration of
  postlarval and adult southern flounders (Reagan and Wingo 1985). In Louisiana
  coastal waters, adult southern flounders have been collected at temperatures
  ranging from 5 - 35 &deg;C.</p>

  <p class="title">Salinity</p>
  <p class="body">Southern flounder are highly <a href="#euryhaline" onClick="popDef('Organisms tolerant of widely ranging salinity', '#euryhaline');" name="euryhaline">euryhaline</a>,
  and withstand fluctuations in salinities ranging from 0- 35&permil; or more.  Data
  from Smith et al. (1999) indicates that salinity tolerance in this species
  increases with age.</p>
  <p class="body">Adult <i>P. lethostigma</i> make extensive migrations
  from estuarine habitats in order to spawn in offshore waters. Eggs of <i>P.
  lethostigma</i> are buoyant at 32 &permil;, and sink at 29&permil;, though data indicate
  that eggs that sink may still hatch. Experiments conducted by Smith et al.
  (1999) showed that eggs incubated in water with a salinity between 0-5 &permil; all
  died within a day. Eggs incubated at 10 &permil; had greater hatching success
  (82%), but all larvae moved sluggishly and died shortly after hatching. Eggs
  incubated in water of salinities between 15 - 35 &permil; were normal in appearance
  and were active. However, larvae reared through metamorphosis to the juvenile
  stage showed greater mortality at 15&permil; salinity than at either 25&permil; or 35&permil;.
  Further, recently metamorphosed juveniles showed less tolerance to freshwater
  conditions than did older fish (Smith et al. 1999).</p>
  <p class="body">Southern flounder eggs and larvae from wild
  populations develop in offshore waters, with late stage, premetamorphic larvae
  (stage 4b - 5), likely returned to estuarine habitats via passive transport on
  nearshore and tidal currents. Once returned to estuaries, larvae settle on the
  substratum and metamorphose into juveniles. In one North Carolina study,
  comparative data from Burke et al. (1991) suggests that settlement in <i>P.
  lethostigma</i> is influenced by salinity. These authors reported that though
  larvae of both summer and southern flounder begin to recruit into estuaries
  during February, southern flounder larvae concentrated on tidal flats near the
  heads of estuaries where salinity ranged from 9 - 25&permil;, and the substratum
  had a low sand content (4 - 50%). Conversely, summer flounder larvae settled
  more downstream, in the middle reaches of estuaries where salinity ranged from
  24 - 35&permil; and the substratum had a much higher sand content (53 - 95 %).</p>
  <p class="body">Burke et al. (1991) also reported that juvenile
  southern flounder moved further upstream to more riverine environments later
  in the spring, while juvenile summer flounder tended to remain in higher
  salinity tidal areas near <i>Spartina</i> saltmarshes. Catch comparisons
  showed that approximately equal numbers of southern flounder were caught in
  sandy versus muddy substrate types in low salinity waters; while summer
  flounder were most abundant in sandy <a href="#substrata" onClick="popDef('Sediments, surfaces, or media that an organism may settle on, burrow into or live upon', '#substrata');" name="substrata">substrata</a> in higher salinity waters.
  Burke et al. (1991) concluded that southern flounder settlement is more highly
  correlated with salinity, while summer flounder settlement is more highly
  correlated with substratum type.</p>

  <p class="title">Other Physical Tolerances</p>
  <p class="body"><b>Dissolved Oxygen</b><br />
    <i>P. lethostigma</i> tolerates low dissolved oxygen concentrations (less than 5  mg/l). However, in a laboratory study, postlarval southern flounder attempted avoidance when dissolved
  oxygen concentrations in culture vessels fell
  below 3.7 mg/l (Reagan and Wingo 1985).</p>
</li>
   <li>
   	<p class="heading">COMMUNITY ECOLOGY</p>
	<p class="title">Trophic Mode</p>
  <p class="body">Southern flounder are carnivorous fishes that
  are generally considered to be top or near-top predators. Larvae reared under
  laboratory conditions begin feeding on rotifers 4 - 6 days posthatch. By 8 -
  13 days posthatch, larvae begin to feed on newly hatched <i>Artemia</i>
  nauplii (Denson and Smith 1997).</p>
  <p class="body">Small southern flounders consume a wide variety of
  invertebrate prey, but upon reaching approximately 20 mm total length (TL),
  they become primarily piscivorous (Reagan and Wingo 1985). Based on
  differences in morphology and behavior between summer flounder and southern
  flounder in North Carolina, Burke (1995) compared prey distribution and
  feeding ecology between the 2 species following metamorphosis to the juvenile
  stage. Southern flounder juveniles have generally larger mouths, larger,
  inwardly curved teeth, and fewer, heavier gill rakers than do summer flounder.
  They also tend to remain still on the bottom, waiting for prey to come within
  striking distance (Minello et al. 1987; Burke 1995). Small southern flounder
  primarily consumed amphipods and mysid shrimp, followed by copepods, insects,
  fish and invertebrate parts. In this study, summer flounder 20 - 60 mm SL
  consumed spionid polychaete worms, followed by clam siphons, mysid shrimp,
  calanoid copepods, the blue crab, <i>Callinectes</i> <i>sapidus</i>, and small
  fishes. From this data, Burke (1995) concluded that post-settlement
  differences in feeding habits developed between the 2 species, with southern
  flounder shifting to more mobile prey which could be attacked from below, and
  summer flounder continuing to feed upon benthic prey organisms.</p>
  <p class="body">The adult diet of <i>P. lethostigma</i> consists
  primarily of fish, but is augmented by crustaceans depending upon regional
  location. In Louisiana, adult southern flounders eat shrimp and fish; though,
  Fox and White (1969) reported that the primary prey species for southern
  flounder was striped mullet (<i>Mugil cephalus</i>). Also included in the diet
  are fat sleepers (<i>Dormitator maculatus</i>) and anchovies (<i>Anchoa spp</i>.).
  Larger flounders (150 mm long) ate primarily anchovies, menhaden (<i>Brevoortia
  spp</i>.), sciaenids, and mullet (Reagan and Wingo 1985).</p>
  
  <p class="title">Habitats</p>
  <p class="body">Adult <i>P. lethostigma</i> spend the warmer
  months in coastal embayments and riverine habitats in the upper reaches of
  estuaries (Rogers and Van Den Avyle 1983). Many adults migrate to offshore
  spawning grounds during late fall and winter, though some do remain in
  estuaries year-round. Larvae spawned offshore make their return to estuarine
  habitats by passive transport on nearshore and tidal currents. In a study
  conducted in North Carolina, Burke et al. (1991) reported that peak
  recruitment into estuaries by late stage (stage 4b and 5), premetamorphic
  larvae occurred in February, though larvae were collected from late November
  through mid-April. These larvae settled into tidal mudflats near the head of
  the estuary, however, in spring, southern flounder apparently migrated
  upstream into riverine habitats. Spring through summer, southern flounder
  prefer the silt and mud substrata of coastal bays and river systems, and
  become most common in the upper reaches of estuaries, sometimes entering
  freshwater (Burke et al. 1991; Smith et al. 1999).</p>
  <p class="body">In a comparative study, Burke et al. (1991) reported
  that larvae of both southern and summer flounder recruit into estuaries during
  the same period, and for a time, show considerable overlap in distribution
  within an estuary. However, segregation occurs quickly (Burke et al. 1991;
  Burke 1995). Premetamorphic larvae of southern flounder tend to concentrate on
  tidal flats in the upper reaches of estuaries where salinity ranges from 9 -
  25&permil;, and the substratum consists of 4 - 45 % sand. Conversely,
  premetamorphic larvae from summer flounder generally move into silt and
  mudflat areas in the lower and middle reaches of estuaries where salinity
  ranges from 24 - 35&permil; and the substratum consists of 50 - 95 % sand (Burke
  et al. 1991). Capture data following segregation of the 2 species within the
  Newport River Estuary, North Carolina, showed that summer flounder were most
  common on sand flats than on mudflats in the lower estuary, while there was
  little difference in capture rates among southern flounder in sandy vs. muddy
  substrates in the upper reaches of the estuary. Burke et al. (1991) concluded
  that settlement in <i>P. dentatus</i> is most likely influenced by substratum
  type, while that of <i>P. lethostigma</i> is influenced by salinity.</p>
  
  <p class="title">Activity Time</p>
  <p class="body">A tank study showed that southern flounder
  tend to be more active at night than during the day (Reagan and Wingo 1985).</p>

  <p class="body">The southern flounder is a valuable sport and
  commercial fish along the Gulf coast of the United States. Most of the commercial catch in the Gulf
  of Mexico is incidental to the catch by shrimp trawlers. There has been
  significant interest in utilizing southern flounder as an aquaculture species.
  Studies in the southeastern U.S. and in the Gulf of Mexico are currently
  underway to improve spawning techniques and develop larval rearing methods for
  southern flounder in order to improve its attractiveness as an aquaculture
  product (Jenkins and Smith 1999; Smith et al. 1999).</p>
<p class="body">Flounders of all species are harvested annually from
waters in and around the Indian River Lagoon, and are especially prized by recreational
anglers. However, the commercial fishery is not of particularly high value.
For the years 1987 - 2001, 1.7 million pounds of flounders were harvested, with
a dollar value of over $3.1 million reported in the 5 county area encompassing
the IRL (Volusia, Brevard, Indian River, St. Lucie and Martin Counties).
This ranks flounders nineteenth in commercial value within the IRL, and
twenty-ninth in pounds harvested. </p>
<p class="body">Figure 1 below shows the dollar value of the flounder
fishery to IRL counties by year. Note that all species of flounders were
combined in the data presented. As shown, commercial catch ranged from a low of $77,149 in
1987 to a high of over $350,927 in 1999. Volusia County annually accounts
for the largest percentage of the flounder catch with 83% in total (Figure 2),
followed distantly by Brevard County, which accounts for 8% of the total.
Indian River, St. Lucie and Martin Counties account for 3%, 4% and 2% of the
total respectively. Note that the fishery's value brings in $125,000 -
$300,000 annually to Volusia County businesses, while in all other IRL counties,
the dollar value is typically less than $25,000.</p>

  <p class="body"><b>Recreational Fishery</b><br />
  The recreational
flounder fishery in Florida accounts for 65 - 70% of the annual state-wide
harvest (Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission 2004). Landings on
the Gulf coast of Florida are somewhat lower than those on the East coast,
averaging approximately 198,015 pounds per year. On the Atlantic coast,
landings have averaged less than 300,000 pounds per year since 2001.
However, catch rates on both coasts are apparently stable, and have remained so
since the early 1990s.</p>
<p class="body">Southern flounder are recreationally important in the
Indian River Lagoon on a seasonal basis, specifically during the late fall and
winter when large specimens may be landed as they migrate out of the lagoon for
spawning. This species was first regulated by the State of Florida in
1996, when a 10-fish bag limit and 12-inch minimum size limit was implemented.</p>
<p class="body">Since 1997, the recreational
harvest in the 5-county area encompassing the Indian River Lagoon has remained
fairly consistent, with 1.3 million fishes harvested, an average of 166,500 per
year taken by recreational anglers between 1997 - 2001. The lowest harvest
was recorded in 2004, when 133,643 southern flounder were captured. The
highest harvest occurred in 1999 when 201,195 southern flounder were taken.
Approximately 45.8% of the catch was taken
in inland waters other than the Indian River Lagoon. Within the IRL,
anglers caught 379,472 southern flounder, 28.5% of the total. Coastal waters from the shoreline to 3 miles offshore
accounted for 23.2%, while offshore waters to 200 miles accounted for only 2.4%.</p>
