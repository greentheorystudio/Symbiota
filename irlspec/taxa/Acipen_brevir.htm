	<p class="title">Species Description</p>
              <p class="body"><em>Acipenser brevirostrum</em> is one of 5
              North American Acipenser species. An evolutionarily primitive species,
              dating back at least 70 million years, it is a large, elongate fish
              that grow to approximately 1 - 1.3 m (3.3 - 4.3 feet) in length
              (Page and Burr 1991). The upper jaw is elongate and ends in a blunt,
              shovel-like, snout. The tail is shark-like (heterocercal), with
              the upper lobe longer than the lower. The head is convex in profile,
              and armored with bony plates. The mouth is ventral and broad. Four
              barbels extend across the width of the snout and are set midway
              between the mouth and the tip of the snout. No teeth are present
              in adults. Five rows of bony scutes line the length of the body:
              1 row is set mid-dorsally, 2 are set laterally and 2 are set dorso-laterally.
              Scutes are somewhat sharper in young specimens, gradually becoming
              blunter and rounded in older fish. Denticles are distributed in
              small patches over the body surface (Bigelow et al. 1963; Robins,
              C.R. and G.C. Ray, 1986 ; Gilbert 1989).</p>
            <p class="body">The dorsal and anal fins are set
              posteriorly and are opposite one another, though the origin of the
              anal fin is set behind the dorsal origin. No dorsal spines, anal
              spines, or post-dorsal shields are present. There are 33-42 soft
              dorsal rays, 18-24 anal rays, and 22-29 gill rakers. Body color
              generally ranges from dark brown to black above, to a paler light
              brown or yellow color ventrolaterally, to white ventrally. There
              is little sexual dimorphism, though females tend to grow somewhat
              larger. Sex can be determined externally only during spawning. Newly
              hatched shortnose sturgeons are larger than Atlantic sturgeons (<em>Acipenser oxyrhinchus</em>) of the same age, though after 2 years of age,
              Atlantic sturgeons grow significantly larger (Bigelow et al. 1963;
              Robins, C.R. and G.C. Ray, 1986 ; Gilbert 1989). </p>
            <p class="title">Potentially Misidentified Species</p>
              <p class="body">Shortnose sturgeons are sympatric with
              Atlantic sturgeons. Adults are easily distinguished based on size:
               shortnose sturgeons grow to approximately 1m (3.3 feet) in
              length, while the Atlantic sturgeon grows longer than 4 m (13.1
              feet). Additionally, the snout in shortnose sturgeons is broader
              and shorter than in the Atlantic sturgeon. Atlantic sturgeons
              also have a set of enlarged, bony plates set between the base of
              the anal fin and the lateral row of scutes. These are not present
              in shortnose sturgeons. Internally, the intestine of shortnose sturgeons
              is much more darkly pigmented than in Atlantic sturgeons (Gilbert
              1989). </p>

  	<p class="heading">HABITAT AND DISTRIBUTION</p>
    <p class="title">Regional Occurrence</p>
              <p class="body"><em>Acipenser brevirostrum</em> ranges along the entire Atlantic
              coast of North America, from the Saint John River in New Brunswick,
              Canada to the St. Johns River, Florida (Gilbert 1989). The federal
              recovery plan (NMFS 1998) for this endangered fish identifies 19
              distinct population segments, each defined as a river/estuarine
              system in which shortnose sturgeons have been captured within the
              generation time of the species (30 years). It is significantly more
              common in northern portions of its range than it is in the south.
              </p>
            <p class="title">IRL Distribution</p>
              <p class="body">Shortnose sturgeons have been documented to occur in Volusia County
              and some other areas of the IRL (Evermann and Bean 1898), but sightings
              are extremely rare. One of the 19 population segments listed by
              the NMFS is the St. Johns River Basin. </p>

              <p class="heading">LIFE HISTORY AND POPULATION BIOLOGY</p>
            <p class="title">Age, Size, Lifespan</p>
              <p class="body"><em>Acipenser brevirostrum</em> grows to a length of approximately
              1m (3.3 feet). Maximum recorded length was reported by Birstein
              (1993) as 143 cm (4.7 feet) total length (TL) in a specimen that
              weighed 23 kg (50.7 pounds). Maximum known age is 67 years for females
              and 30 years for males (Riede 2004).</p>

            <p class="title">Abundance</p>
              <p class="body">Shortnose sturgeons are listed as Endangered throughout their range;
              however, adults tend to be more abundant in the north than in the
              south (Kynard 1996). Studies show populations in Maine, New York,
              and Connecticut are apparently increasing slowly, to the point where
              they may become downlisted to Threatened at some point in the future
              (NMFS 1998). However, in the Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida,
              low juvenile abundance indicates that recruitment has not increased
              despite an apparent increase in the adult population from the stocking
              of hatchery-reared fish during 1985-1992 (NMFS 1998; Collins et
              al. 2002).</p>
            <p class="title">Reproduction</p>
              <p class="body"><em>Acipenser brevirostrum</em> is an anadromous species that spends much of its
              life in brackish or marine waters, but migrates into upstream, freshwater
              areas of coastal rivers for spawning. Maturation is slow, and varies
              according to latitude, with southern fish maturing faster than northern
              fish (Gilbert 1989). Dadswell et al. (1984) reported shortnose sturgeons
              maturing at a body size of approximately 45 - 55 cm (1.5 - 1.8 feet)
              fork length (FL). Males matured at approximately 2 - 3 years of
              age in Georgia, 3 - 5 years in South Carolina, and 10 - 11 years
              in New Brunswick, Canada. Females mature over significantly longer
              periods of time, with southern females becoming reproductive by
              Age 6, and Canadian females maturing at 13 years of age. Dadswell
              (1979) reported that for the population as a whole, the 50% maturation
              average is 12.4 years for males and 17.2 years for females, with
              first spawning occurring at 14 years in males, and 15 years in females.
              Spawning periodicity in males is more frequent than in females.
              Males in Canadian rivers spawned at 2-year intervals, while females
              spawned approximately every 3-5 years (Dadswell 1979).</p>
            <p class="body">Prior to spawning, egg diameter is approximately
              3.1 mm (0.12 inches), and ovaries may comprise as much as 25% of
              female body weight (Dadswell 1979). Fecundity estimates have been
              reported in several studies. Smith (1985) reported a range of 40,000
              - 200,000 eggs per female; Heidt and Gilbert (1987) reported fecundity
              of Florida fish as 79,000 - 90,000 eggs for females measuring 75
              - 87 cm in length. Dadswell (1984) reported a range of 27,000 -
              208,000 eggs per female in New Brunswick sturgeon; with mean of
              11,568 eggs per kg body weight.</p>
            <p class="body">Reproduction varies latitudinally due to the
              effect of differing temperature regimes, with southern sturgeons
              beginning spawning migrations earlier than those in the north. Shortnose
              sturgeons begin prespawning migrations earlier in the year than
              do Atlantic sturgeons of similar latitudes, likely as the result
              of water temperatures cues. Migration occurs throughout the winter
              and spring months, with males typically leading migrating schools
              (Dadswell et al. 1984).</p>
            <p class="body">Ripening and some non-ripening adults spend
              the winter months in deep water in the lower reaches of rivers and
              estuaries. In northern areas, arrival onto spawning ground corresponds
              with water temperatures of 8 - 9&deg;C. Dadswell et al. (1984)
              reported spawning occurs as early as February in Georgia, in April-May
              in the Connecticut River, and as late as mid-May in New Brunswick;
              usually at temperatures of 9-12&deg;C during or soon after peak
              flows. Spawning is generally compressed and may be as short as 3
              - 5 days (Taubert 1980), typically occurring well upriver from summer
              foraging and nursery grounds Spawning adults may travel 200 km (124.3
              miles) or more upstream (Kynard 1996). During spawning, males initiate
              spawning behavior in response to release of female pheromones (Kynard
              and Horgan 2002).</p>
            <p class="body">A variety of substrates are utilized for spawning,
              and include areas of gravel, mixed sand-gravel, rubble, or even
              large boulders (Dadswell et al. 1984). However, water velocity and
              depth are perhaps more important than substrate type in determining
              spawning location (Buckley and Kynard 1985). Current velocities
              are generally low to moderate on spawning grounds, typically with
              the range of 40 - 60 cm/sec (1.3 - 2 feet/sec). Buckley and Kynard
              (1985) hypothesized that too slow a current would cause the highly
              adhesive eggs to clump together, causing respiratory stress, allowing
              for fungal growth, and perhaps increasing egg predation. However,
              eggs released into flowing but not strong currents would not clump,
              and their transport downstream would be assured.</p>
            <p class="body">Females in the Saint John River, New Brunswick
              fast for approximately 8 months before spawning, whereas males continue
              feeding (Dadswell 1979). Southern populations tend to fast during
              the summer (Rogers et al. 1994).</p>
            <p class="body">Spent individuals gradually return to brackish
              or marine waters. In the Savannah River, downstream migrations began
              in mid-March and ended by early May, with individuals migrating
              as much as 33 km/day (20.5 miles) (Hall et al. 1991). Huff
              (1975) reported downstream migrations in Florida occurring from
              October through December.</p>
            <p class="title">Embryology</p>
              <p class="body">During spawning, eggs are
              broadcast into flowing water. Eggs measure approximately 3 mm (0.12
              inches) in diameter (Vladykov and Greely 1963), are demersal, and
              become strongly adhesive after approximately 20 minutes. Under laboratory
              conditions, eggs hatched after 8 days at a water temperature of
              17.8&deg;C, and 13 days at a temperature of 10&deg;C.
              Larvae are blackish in color at hatching and measure 7 - 11 mm (0.3
              - 0.4 inches) in length (Dadswell et al. 1984). Laboratory hatched
              larvae hatched were photonegative, relatively weak swimmers, and
              readily sought out any available cover (NMFS 1998).</p>
            <p class="body">Yolk-sac larvae are robust and become
              a dull brown color with scattered melanophores that increased in
              number as yolk is absorbed. The mouth becomes visible when larvae
              reach 8.4 mm (0.33 inches) in length; gills are visible at 9.5 mm
              (0.37 inches); barbells are visible at 9.7 mm (0.38 inches); the
              eye is fully formed at 11 mm (0.43 inches). Fins are well developed
              when larvae reach 14 mm (0.55 inches), approximately the time when
              the yolk-sac is fully absorbed (Dadswell et al. 1984). Dermal ossification
              and dorsal scutes become visible at approximately 19.0 mm (0.74
              inches), with metamorphosis complete by 31.5 mm (1.24 inches). At
              this size, the snout becomes more elongate, scutes are countable,
              and the skull is ossified and opaque. The juvenile stage persists
              until young fish reach approximately 45 cm (17.7 inches) FL at about
              3 years of age, depending on latitude (Dadswell et al. 1984). Larvae
              of shortnose sturgeon can be distinguished from Atlantic sturgeon
              larvae at approximately 14.5 cm (0.57 inches) TL based on the ratio
              of mouth width to head width, with the shortnose sturgeon having
              a significantly wider mouth (Bath et al. 1981).</p>
            <p class="body">Buckley and Kynard (1985) reported
              active, vertical swimming in newly hatched larvae, perhaps an adaptation
              to downriver transport. Larvae and juveniles have been reported
              from, and may prefer, deep river channels (Richmond and Kynard 1995)
              above the salt wedge. Bath et al. (1981) reported larvae occurring
              at depths of 9.1 - 9.8 m (29.9 - 32.1 feet) where water temperatures
              were 15.0 - 24.5&deg;C
              (59 - 76.1&deg;F), in salinities of approximately 0 - 22 parts per thousand (ppt).
             </p>
            <p class="body">Growth is rapid in the first 3 years
              of life (Dadswell 1979), with shortnose sturgeon in the southern
              portion of the range growing faster than northern fishes (Dadswell
              et al. 1984). At the end of the first year of life, juveniles may
              measure 14 - 30 cm (5.5 - 11.8 inches), depending on latitude (Dadswell
              et al. 1984). Daily growth was estimated to be as much as 0.3 mm
              (0.01 inches) per day (Pekovitch 1979). After 3 years, juveniles
              enter a period of even, but less rapid growth until approximately
              8 - 10 years of age.</p>
            <p class="body">With the onset of sexual maturity,
              males grow somewhat faster than females of the same age. Growth
              decelerates after age 11 in males, but remains steady throughout
              life. Females have a more inconsistent growth pattern, where periods
              of rapid growth are followed by check periods of 3-5 years where
              little, if any, measurable growth occurs. After check periods, there
              is a burst of rapid growth. Dadswell et al. (1984) suggested check
              periods were related to gonadal development and maturation. At or
              near age 15, there is a consistent period of growth reduction that
              likely corresponds to preparation for the first spawning period.

    <p class="title">Temperature</p>
              <p class="body">Upper and lower lethal temperature have not been determined in <em>Acipenser
              brevirostrum</em> as it is an Endangered species. However, observations
              suggest that 22&deg;C (71.6&deg;F) may
              be approaching an upper tolerance limit, as individuals are seldom
              found in areas where water temperatures exceed 22 &deg;C
              (Dovel 1979 and Dadswell et al 1984). In Florida, surface water
              temperatures above 21 &deg;C
              (69.8&deg;F) apparently
              stimulated movement of shortnose sturgeons into deeper waters. However,
              in the Connecticut River, Dadswell et al. (1984) reported that sturgeons
              are frequently captured in less than 1m of water with temperatures
              of 27-30 &deg;C (80.6 - 86&deg;F) (Dadswell
              et al. 1984). Flournoy et al. (1992) reported physiologic stress
              when water temperature exceeded 28 &deg;C
              (82.4&deg;F).
              Bath et al. (1981) reported larvae occurring at depths of 9.1 -
              9.8 m (29.9 - 32.1 feet) where water temperatures were 15.0 - 24.5
              &deg;C (59 - 76.1&deg;F).</p>
            <p class="title">Salinity</p>
              <p class="body">Shortnose sturgeons prefer lower salinity
              than pure seawater, typically in the range of 30 - 31 ppt (Holland
              and Yelverton 1973; Dadswell et al 1984). In areas where <em>Acipenser
              brevirostrum</em> occurs with the Atlantic sturgeon, <em>A. oxyrhinchus</em>,
              the two species apparently segregate the habitat according to salinity
              preferences, with Atlantic sturgeon preferring more saline areas.
              Gilbert (1990) suggested that though the shortnose sturgeon is capable
              of entering the open ocean, it is hesitant to do so. This factor
              may be the single largest consideration limiting extensive coastal
              migrations of this species. Bath et al. (1981) reported larvae occurring
              in salinities of approximately 0 - 22 ppt.</p>
            <p class="title">Other Physical Tolerances</p>
              <p class="body">The long life span of <em>Acipenser brevirostrum</em>, as well as
              its lifestyle as a benthic predator likely predisposes individuals
              to the effects of bioaccumulation of heavy metals, pesticides, polychlorinated
              aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)
              (Cooper 1989; Sindermann 1994; NMFS 1998).</p>
            <p class="title">Dissolved oxygen</p>
              <p class="body">Jenkins et al. (1993) reported 90% mortality in laboratory populations
              of shortnose sturgeon larvae when dissolved oxygen concentrations
              were below 2.5 mg/L. Though, fishes older than 100 days were able
              to tolerate the same levels of dissolved oxygen with less than 20%
              mortality.</p>

	<p class="title">Trophic Mode</p>
              <p class="body"><em>Acipenser
              brevirostrum</em> is primarily a benthic feeder, though some observations
              report it selecting snails from the leaves of freshwater or estuarine
              plants.</p>
            <p class="body">Dadswell (1979) reported an ontogenetic shift
              in prey preferences in shortnose sturgeon. Young juveniles reportedly
              fed primarily on benthic crustaceans and insect larvae. Fishes 20-30
              cm (7.9 -11.8 inches) FL fed primarily on cladocerans (Dadswell
              et al. 1984), while adults fed on mollusks, polychaetes, and small
              benthic fishes. Zebra mussel remains have also been found in feces
              of individuals from the Hudson River (USFWS 1998; Dadswell et al.
              1984; Dadswell 1979 ).</p>
            <p class="body">Shortnose sturgeons are indiscriminate feeders
              that use their broad snouts to root out benthic organisms. Prey
              movement is detected by the 4 barbels set in front of the mouth.
              The mouth is protrusible and suction feeding occurs when prey are
              detected. This mode of feeding also brings large amounts of mud
              and organic debris into the mouth. Dadswell (1979) reported stomach
              contents often contained 85 - 95% mud and other non-food material.</p>
            <p class="title">Competitors</p>
              <p class="body">Shortnose sturgeons do not compete strongly with other species (USFWS
              1998). There may be some level of competition with other benthic
              feeders, especially those that consume mollusks, however, any direct
              competitive interaction with another species is likely offset by
              the shortnose sturgeon's non-specific feeding habits.</p>
            <p class="title">Predators</p>
              <p class="body"><em>Acipenser brevirostrum</em> is not the main prey item of any
              known species (USFWS 1998).</p>
            <p class="title">Parasites</p>
              <p class="body">Dadswell et al. (1984) reported<em> Acipenser brevirostrum</em>
              is sometimes parasitized by sea lampreys, coelenterates, nematodes,
              leeches, arthropods, and flatworms. Infestation intensity was reportedly
              low.</p>
            <p class="title">Habitats</p>
              <p class="body">Shortnose sturgeons inhabit river mouths,
              lakes, estuaries, bays, and some near-shore benthic areas. Some
              are reported to occasionally enter open marine waters. Individuals
              less than 5 years of age use primarily estuarine habitats for most
              of the year (Wilk and Silverman 1976). Adults generally utilize
              separate summer and wintering areas, though greatest abundance occurs
              in estuaries. Due to damming operations in the Connecticut River,
              as well as in rivers of Maine and South Carolina, several populations
              of shortnose sturgeon are reported to be restricted to freshwater
              (USFWS 1998).</p>
            <p class="body">Critical habitat areas in river systems in
              the southern United States are those at the saltwater/freshwater
              interface (Flournoy et al. 1992, Rogers and Weber 1995). Access
              to upstream areas of rivers unimpeded by dams is also considered
              critical (USFWS 1998).</p>
            <p class="body">Foraging habitat includes vegetated backwaters,
              and shallow river banks where water is less than 2m (6.6 feet) deep
              (Dadswell et al 1984). In late summer, when water temperatures are
              elevated, feeding occurs in deeper areas.</p>
            <p class="title">Activity Time</p>
              <p class="body">Most activity of larvae, juveniles, and adults appears to occur
              at night (Dadswell et al. 1984; Richmond and Kynard 1995), though
              shortnose sturgeon are also reported to be active during daylight
              hours when waters are highly turbid (Dadswell et al 1984).</p>
            <p class="body">Seasonally, shortnose sturgeon tend not to
              forage or feed when water temperatures drop below 10&deg;C (Dadswell
              1979; Dadswell et al. 1984).</p>

     <p class="title">Special Status</p>
              <p class="body">The International Union for the Conservation
              of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), which maintains the IUCN
              Red List of species threatened with extinction, lists the shortnose
              sturgeon as Vulnerable to extinction based on habitat loss or degradation
              (infrastructure development, human settlement, dam construction);
              accidental mortality (fisheries bycatch, entrainment in industrial
              water intakes or dredging operations); pollution (non-point source
              agricultural and urban, thermal, oil); negative impacts of invasive
              species; and intrinsic factors (limited dispersal, poor recruitment,
              high juvenile mortality, slow growth).</p>
            <p class="body">The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service first listed
              the shortnose sturgeon as an Endangered species on March 11, 1967,
              when it was first protected under the Endangered Species Preservation
              Act, which predated the Endangered Species Act of 1973. NOAA is
              the lead Federal agency responsible for the protection of endangered
              marine life.</p>
            <p class="body">The State of Florida currently lists the shortnose
              sturgeon as Endangered.</p>
            <p class="title">Why are shortnose sturgeon endangered?</p>
              <p class="body">The shortnose sturgeon never supported a targeted fishery; however,
              they were captured with Atlantic sturgeon as part of a large sturgeon
              fishery, harvests of which exceeded 3,000 metric tons per year until
              the 1880s when overfishing, industrial development, and damming
              of rivers began to negatively impact stocks. Catches declined through
              the early 1900s, until only incidental landings were reported from
              1900 - 1950 (Dadswell et al. 1984; NMFS 1998).</p>
            <p class="body">As there is no longer a commercial or recreational
              fishery for shortnose sturgeon, principal threats primarily involve
              irreversible loss and degradation of habitat. Direct mortality is
              also known to occur from pollution, entrainment in cooling water
              intakes, dredging operations, and incidental capture in other fisheries
              (NMFS 1998).</p>
            <p class="title">Population Estimates</p>
              <p class="body">The IUCN Red List estimates greater than 30% reductions in some
              populations over 3 generations. Further, there are large disparities
              in population numbers between river systems. In several large northern
              river systems, shortnose sturgeon stocks are apparently stable or
              increasing, but populations in southern rivers remain severely depleted.
              For example, estimated total population size for the Hudson River
              (95% confidence interval) is 26,000 - 55,000 individuals. The Saint
              John (New Brunswick, Canada), Kennebec (Maine), and Delaware populations
              of shortnose sturgeon are estimated to range from 5,000 - 15,000.
              The Connecticut River (Massachusetts and Connecticut) has a population
              of approximately 1,200 fish; while the Merrimack River (Massachusetts)
              may have fewer than 100 fish (Kieffer and Kynard 1993, Kynard 1997,
              Savoy 2004).</p>
            <p class="body">In southern river systems, only a few population
              estimates have been conducted. In the Chesapeake Bay region, shortnose
              sturgeon are only rarely documented, and no breeding population
              is apparent. In the Ogeechee and Altamaha Rivers of Georgia, the
              estimated population size of shortnose sturgeon is approximately
              1,000 fish each (Rogers and Weber 1994). Five shortnose sturgeon
              were collected in the St. Johns River, Florida in the late 1970's
              (Dadswell et al. 1984) and, in 1981, three sturgeon were collected
              and released by the Florida Game and Freshwater Fish Commission.
              Interestingly, none of the collections were recorded from the estuarine
              portion of the system; all captures occurred far upstream in an
              area heavily influenced by artesian springs with high mineral content.
             </p>
            <p class="body">The USFWS (1998) has identified 19 somewhat
              genetically distinct population segments of shortnose sturgeon occurring
              from New Brunswick, Canada to Florida. Though estimates of genetic
              variation within and among these shortnose sturgeon populations
              are not available, life history studies indicate that populations
              from different river systems are likely to be reproductively isolated
              (Kynard 1997) and, therefore, should be considered separately. A
              status review of the shortnose sturgeon population conducted in
              1987 recommended managing each of the 19 subpopulations as distinct
              entities. It was further advised that stocks in the Connecticut,
              Delaware, and Hudson River populations could be downlisted to Threatened
              status; while the Kennebec River population could potentially be
              delisted entirely (USFWS 1998).</p>
            <p class="title">Management Priorities and Recovery Strategy</p>
              <p class="body">Under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, populations may be considered
              for downlisting to Threatened status when they reach a minimum population
              size large enough to prevent extinction and prevent loss of genetic
              diversity. The USFWS (1998) Recovery Plan for shortnose sturgeon
              calls for identification and designation of critical habitat areas;
              protection of sturgeon from point source and non-point source pollution,
              as well as other anthropogenic effects. It sets forth the long term
              goal of eventually delisting the shortnose sturgeon through continued
              habitat and water quality assessment; protection of spawning sites,
              and restricting damming and dredging efforts at least during migratory
              or spawning periods. Monitoring and minimization of mortality through
              reduction of bycatch, protection from invasive species, strengthening
              and increased enforcement of anti-poaching regulations, and increased
              pubic education efforts all will be directed toward recovery efforts
              (USFWS 1998).</p>
            <p class="title">Fisheries Importance</p>
              <p class="body"><em>Acipenser brevirostrum</em>, along with other sturgeon species
              that occur along the Atlantic Seaboard, have good quality flesh
              and eggs suitable for use as caviar. They were intensively fished
              for more than 100 years until the fishery collapsed in the 1880s.
              Subsequent industrial development along rivers and coastlines impeded
              recovery of populations by impairing water quality and degrading
              habitats (NMFS 1998). Industrialization may have been especially
              harmful to southernmost populations, including those in Florida
              (Scott 1978). Currently, there are no legal fisheries or by-catch
              allowances for shortnose sturgeon in U.S. territorial waters. This
              species has been listed as Endangered since 1967.</p>
