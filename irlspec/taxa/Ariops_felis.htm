          <p class="title">Species Description</p>
              <p class="body">Both marine (Ariidae) and freshwater catfishes (Ictaluridae) are
              notable for their unscaled skin, forked caudal fins, adipose fins
              set anterior to the caudal peduncle, and the presence of large,
              serrated spines positioned anteriorly to the dorsal fin and the
              pectoral fins. Marine catfishes are separated from Ictalurids based
              on the absence of barbels on the nostrils, and by body color, which
              is typically steel blue dorsally, fading to silver laterally, and
              white ventrally.</p>
            <p class="body"><em>Ariopsis felis</em>, the sea catfish,
              is an elongate marine catfish that reaches 49.5 cm in length (Perret
              et al. 1971). The head is depressed in profile, with the mouth inferior.
              There are 3 pairs of barbels present. The maxillary barbels are
              nearly as long as the head, while the other 2 pairs are much shorter
              and set under the chin. The dorsal fin, anal fin and pectoral fins
              each bear a single strong spine. The dorsal fin has 7 soft rays,
              the anal fin has 19-20 rays and the pectoral fin has 6-10 rays.
              A pair of ventral fins is set far posterior to the origin of the
              dorsal fin. The adipose fin is black in color. The caudal fin and
              anal fins are generally tipped with black, while the remainder of
              the fins are dusky in color. Females have larger pelvic fins than
              males (Lee 1937; Merriman 1940;
              Muncy and Wingo 1983).</p>

              from Cape Cod, Massachusetts south through coastal Florida and the

   		<p class="heading">LIFE HISTORY AND POPULATION BIOLOGY</p>
        <p class="title">Age, Size, Lifespan</p>
              <p class="body">The maximum reported size of a sea catfish was 70.0 cm (27.6 inches)
              total length (TL), with a maximum reported weight of 5.5 kg (12.2
              pounds) (IGFA 2001). The lifespan may be as long as 5 - 8 years
              (Benson 1982; Doermann et al. 1977).</p>
            <p class="body">Age 0 sea catfishes in southwestern
              Florida were measured at 118 - 133 mm (4.6 - 5.2 inches) TL, while
              Age 1 sea catfishes grew to 193 mm (7.6 inches) TL (Gunter and Hall
              1963). </p>
            <p class="title">Reproduction</p>
              <p class="body"><em>Ariopsis felis </em> reaches sexual maturity before the age
              of 2 (Benson 1982). Female size at maturity has been reported within
              the range of 12.6 - 26.5 cm (4.9 - 10.4 inches) (Merriman 1940;
              Benson 1962). In males, maturity is thought to occur at a somewhat
              larger size of approximately 25 cm (9.8 inches) in length (Merriman
              1040).</p>
            <p class="body">Females develop flap-like fatty tissue
              on their pelvic fins at maturity, and thus have larger pelvic fins
              than males of the species (Lee 1937; Merriman 1940). It has been
              proposed that the highly modified pelvic fins may be the site of
              fertilization and may play a role in transferring fertilized eggs
              to the mouth of the male for incubation (Gunter 1947). However,
              it is also possible that males pick up eggs from shallow depression
              in sand, as eggs, while adhesive, tend to be demersal.</p>
            <p class="body">Ward (1957) examined eggs of females
              captured from Mississippi Sound. He noted eggs generally measured
              6-8 mm in diameter in April, 9-14 mm in May, and 14-16 mm in June
              and July. Eggs were enriched with yolk by early June. Motile sperm
              occur in male <em>Ariopsis felis</em> from March - July in Mississippi
              Sound. Spawning occurs from May through August in shallow bays and
              estuarine waters, sometimes in less than 1 m (3.3 feet) of water
              (Muncy and Wingo 1983). </p>
            <p class="title">Embryology</p>
              <p class="body">Oval or elliptical eggs are large at fertilization, measuring 12-19
              mm in diameter (Merriman 1940), are greenish in color, and develop
              in the mouth of the male parent. Parental care by males offsets
              low fecundity of females, which have only 20 - 65 eggs per spawning
              event. Numerous small, non-functioning eggs are often found attached
              to large, viable eggs. Gunter (1947) speculated that these smaller
              eggs might be utilized as a food source for males brooding offspring.</p>
            <p class="body">Eggs of <em>Ariopsis felis</em> are brooded
              in the mouth of males and hatch after approximately 30 days when
              held under laboratory conditions at a temperature of 30&deg;C (86
              &deg;F) (Jones et al 1971). Larvae measure 29 - 45 mm (1.1 - 1.8
              inches) TL at hatching and are retained in the mouths of male parents
              until their yolk sacs are absorbed approximately 2-4 weeks after
              hatching. Adult characteristics are present at absorption of the
              yolk sac but juveniles tend to remain with the parent, returning
              to its mouth for protection, for a short time thereafter.</p>
            <p class="body">Juveniles measure 68-88 mm (2.7 - 3.5 inches)
              TL.</p>

   	<p class="heading">PHYSICAL TOLERANCES</p>
    <p class="title">Temperature</p>
              <p class="body">Adult sea catfishes prefer water temperatures between 25 - 36&deg;C
              (77 - 96.8 &deg;F)(Jones et al 1978), and actively avoid waters
              where temperatures exceed 37&deg;C (99 &deg;F). They also tend
              to avoid water temperatures below 6&deg;C (43 &deg;F) in the winter
              months by migrating offshore where water temperatures are more stable,
              returning to inshore areas in the spring. However, Tabb and Manning
              (1961) reported that catfishes in southern Florida waters remain
              inshore year-round.</p>
            <p class="title">Salinity</p>
              <p class="body">Spawning salinity 13-40 parts per thousand (ppt) (Jones et al. 1978;
              Muncy and Wingo 1983). Harvey (1972) reported that yolk sac larvae
              of the sea catfish were collected at salinities ranging from 8.33
              - 12.78 ppt, but not higher. Juveniles in the same study were collected
              at salinities of 16.6 - 28.32 ppt, with older juveniles able to
              osmoregulate in higher salinities.</p>
            <p class="title">Other Physical Tolerances</p>
              <p class="body">Wang and Nicol (1977) reported on the effects of fuel oil on sea
              catfishes and noted that the lethal concentration where 50% of the
              laboratory population died was 0.14 ml/L (0.0012 ounces per gallon).
              However, the presence of 0.02 ml of oil per liter (0.00018 ounces
              per gallon) of water did not appear to affect feeding behavior in
              sea catfishes. Raising the level to 0.08 ml fuel oil per liter (0.00071
              ounces per gallon) of water caused catfishes to regurgitate food
              and to lose the protective mucus layer of the stomach.</p>

   <li>
   	<p class="heading">COMMUNITY ECOLOGY</p>
	<p class="title">Trophic Mode</p>
              <p class="body">Sea catfishes are opportunistic feeders that utilize mud and sand
              flats as feeding grounds. Algae, seagrasses, cnidarians, sea cucumbers,
              gastropods, polychaetes, shrimps, crabs, and smaller fishes comprise
              the bulk of the diet (Merriman 1940). Several authors have noted
              that blue crabs are a principal food source in the sea catfish diet
              (Gunter 1945; Gallaway and Strawn 1974).</p>
            <p class="body">Males carrying
              eggs or juveniles do not feed (Muncy and Wingo 1983). However, juveniles
              under the protection of a male parent, feed on planktonic crustaceans
              that are within range of, or enter, the parent's mouth (Merriman
              1940).</p>
            <p class="title">Predators</p>
              <p class="body">Reported predators of sea catfishes are the longnose gar, bull shark,
              and large finfishes. Sea catfishes are also commonly caught as bait
              for large gamefishes such as the cobia (Muncy and Wingo 1983).</p>
            <p class="title">Habitats</p>
              <p class="body">Benson (1982) reported that juvenile sea catfishes tend to remain
              in lower salinity estuaries and bays in Mississippi Sound. However,
              Reid (1957), working in Texas, and Pristas and Trent (1978), working
              in Florida, each reported that juvenile sea catfishes were most
              commonly collected in offshore trawl sampling, rarely collected
              while beach seining.</p>
            <p class="body">Depth preferences in gafftopsail
              catfishes are apparently related to bottom type and to water temperature,
              with higher abundances of gafftopsail catfishes noted when ample
              organic debris is present in substrate, and water temperatures are
              above 15&deg;C (Muncy and Wingo 1983).</p>
            <p class="title">Activity Time</p>
              <p class="body">Gunter (1938) and Jones et al. (1978) reported that sea catfishes
              sometimes school nocturnally.</p>

     <p class="heading">ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>
     <p class="title">Special Status</p>
              <p class="body">Limited commercial and recreational importance.</p>

              <p class="title">Fisheries Importance</p>
              <p class="body"><b>Commercial Fishery</b><br />
								Though edible, the sea catfish is not generally
              consumed as a food fish, with many commercial and sport fishers
              regarding it as a nuisance species due to its dorsal and pectoral
              spines, which are large, serrated, and capable of causing painful
              wounds (Muncy and Wingo 1983). However, sea catfishes do have limited
              commercial importance and are harvested for industrial purposes
              in commercial bottom trawling operations (Muncy and Wingo 1983)
              and are taken recreationally for both bait and as food.</p>
            <p class="body">From
              1987 - 2001, 1.04 million pounds of marine catfishes (including
              both the sea catfish, <em>Ariopsis felis</em>, and <em>Bagre marinus</em>,
              the gafftopsail catfish) were harvested commercially in the 5-county
              area (Volusia, Brevard, Indian River, St. Lucie, Martin) encompassing
              the Indian River Lagoon. The harvest was valued at $777,497, which
              ranks marine catfishes thirty-fifth in dollar value to IRL counties,
              and forty-second in pounds harvested.</p>
            <p class="body">Figure 1 below shows the
              dollar value of the commercial fishery of marine catfishes to IRL
              counties by year. As shown, the commercial catch ranged from
              a low of $9,167 in 1989 to a high of over $344,931 in 1992.
              Martin County accounted for the largest percentage of the marine
              catfish harvest with 32.8% in total (Figure 2), followed by
              St. Lucie County, which accounts for 21.5% of the total. Brevard,
              Volusia, and Indian River Counties accounted for 19.1%, 16.9% and
              9.7% of the total respectively. Interestingly, the six-year
              period between 1990 - 1995 accounts for 87% of the total harvest
              of catfishes in the vicinity of the IRL. Of note is that 44% of
              the cumulative harvest for the entire period between 1987 - 2001
              occurs in 1992, a clearly anomalous year. Martin County again accounts
              for the bulk of the harvest in 1992, however, the other 4 IRL Counties
              also saw greatly increased catches of catfishes in this year.</p>

             <p class="body"><b>Recreational Fishery</b><br /> Though the sea catfish is considered a nuisance species by many
              anglers, it is among the thirty most harvested species within the
              IRL region based on Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey
              information compiled by the National Marine Fisheries Service. From
              1997 - 2001 IRL anglers captured 123,022 sea catfishes either for
              use as bait, or for food.</p>
              <p class="body">Another 238,000 sea catfishes were harvested from other inshore
              waters, nearshore waters and offshore waters around the IRL. The
              bulk of the recreational harvest (35.7%), was taken in nearshore
              waters to the 3-mile state territorial limit. The IRL accounts for
              34.1% of the harvest, while other inland waters, and offshore waters
              to the 200-mile federal limit account for 38.6% and 1.7% of the
              catch respectively.</p>
