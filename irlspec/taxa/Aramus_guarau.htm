              rail-like wading bird, about the size of a White Ibis (Eudocimus
              albus). Mass 0.9-1.3 kg. Wings broad and rounded; wingspan about
              1 m. Plumage uniform dark olive-brown, paler on face, chin, and
              throat, with slight bronze iridescence on wings and especially tail.
              Most feathers have triangular white markings, largest on wings and
              back, giving spotted appearance. Juvenile similar in color to adult
              but has narrower white triangles, giving streaked (not spotted)
              appearance. Legs and feet dull olive-black. Strong flier, runner,
              and swimmer; climbs and perches readily on tree limbs. Male usually
              larger than female, with distinctly different call; otherwise sexes
              difficult to distinguish in the field. Sometimes sulking and secretive
              in riparian vegetation but at other times extremely prominent, with
              loud and repetitive calling. Congregates in loose colonies in areas
              of optimal habitat but apparently also where habitat is uniform
              and widespread.</font></p>
            <p>Basic plumage mostly dark olive-brown, darkest on hindneck, interscapulars,
              and lower back, with bronzy or purplish iridescence on wings and
              especially tail. Ends of primaries darker than wing-coverts; tail-feathers
              even darker brown. Lores, malar region, chin, and upper throat dull
              white and unmarked or faintly streaked with brown. Most feathers,
              except primaries and rectrices, have wide white streak along shaft
              that comes to point at end of feather. Overlapping of larger feathers
              creates bold, bright-white triangles on back, scapulars, and especially
              wing-coverts. Toward neck, triangles become much narrower and appear
              as streaks, giving whitish cast to neck and head. White triangles
              on wing-coverts can be helpful in field in identifying sex of adults.
              Probably because adult males generally larger than females, wing-covert
              triangles seem wider, longer, and more prominent than do those of
              females. Long triangles on 1 or 2 outermost (largest) greater-coverts
              usually visible on male but hidden on female (Bryan 1996b</p>
            <p>Bill twice as long as head; slender, compressed, slightly decurved,
              both mandibles laterally grooved for about two-thirds their length
              (Gosse 1847, Coues 1903). Bill of equal width almost from base to
              tip. A gap in bill (edges of bill do not quite meet in center of
              bill) may function by making ends tweezerlike for better grasping
              of prey (A. Wetmore in Howell 1932). Lower mandible curved to right
              in all juveniles and adults; upper mandible often curved, but not
              as prominently. Underlying bone usually not curved (Snyder and Snyder
              1969). </p>
            <p>Eyes rather large (Audubon 1840). Iris Vandyke brown; eyelid dull
              yellow.Downy young have dark legs and feet (Nicholson 1928). During
              week 3, legs begin to lengthen noticeably; until shortly after starting
              to fly, juvenile has noticeably thicker, paler legs (Ingalls 1972,
              Nesbitt 1978). Adult tarsus and toes dull olive black; claws darker,
              nearly black (Wetmore 1965). Tibia bare in its lower half; tarsus
              long, compressed, anteriorly broad scutellate. Feet very long, rather
              stout</p>
            <p>Males usually larger than females. Ten males measured; all measurements
              given in cm, mean (range): wing length 31.3 (30.0-32.5); tarsus
              13.0 (10.8-14.0); culmen 12.6 (11.6-13.5). Four females measured:
              wing length 30.5 (30.3-31.6); tarsus 12.6 (11.1-13.5); culmen 12.0
              (11.7-12.6; all Florida specimens; Peters 1925). Average body mass
              for 4 adult males from Leon and Lake Cos., FL, was 1,240 g (range
              1,130-1,370); for 4 adult females 1,080 g (range 1,050-1,170; Bryan
              1981). Thirty-one unsexed adults in Marion Co., FL, averaged 1,080
              g (range 900-1,270; Nesbitt et al. 1976).</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Most easily confused in the field with immature White Ibis and
              immature Glossy Ibis (Plegadis falcinellus), but distinguishable
              by overall chocolate-brown color, white-spotted appearance, straighter
              and thicker bill, and dark legs. Immature Black-crowned Night-Heron
              (Nycticorax nycticorax) and Yellow-crowned Night-Heron (Nyctanassa
              violacea) are brown and about the same size but have shorter necks
              and short, straight bills and paler legs.</p>
            <p>Hatchlings have long, thick, soft down; often described as black,
              and even shiny black and jet black (Audubon 1840, Sprunt 1948, L.
              Walkinshaw unpubl.). Within 2-3 d, color becomes very dark brown
              or dark brownish black, with lighter umber around eyes (Ingalls
              1972, Walkinshaw 1982). Color change may result from fading but
              not yet explained. Over first 2 wk, down becomes progressively lighter,
              varying from cinnamon brown to snuff brown, generally darker above
              and paler below, with chin, throat, and upper foreneck, indistinct
              supercilium, malar region, and upper belly dull white (Bent 1926,
              Wetmore 1965). Older downy young and juveniles often appear to have
              rusty-colored crowns (DCB).Remiges begin to emerge at week 3. During
              week 4, feathers with white streaks develop on wings and scapular
              region, followed by feathers of tail, back, wing-coverts, and back
              of neck. At end of week 4, down remains only on top of head, neck,
              and rump. Down on head and neck appears much paler and supercilium
              more distinct. Next, streaked feathers develop on the breast. By
              the end of week 5, juvenile fully feathered with no down apparent
              (Ingalls 1972).</p>

              territories, finally settling on territory of kow-calling unpaired
              male.After pair-bonding, pairs mostly forage and rest side by side
              until incubation.Copulation continues from pair formation until
              incubation starts, with slight increase in frequency during week
              preceding incubation; also occurs between laying eggs (Ingalls 1972).
              Male initiates copulation with soft rattling and clucking, approaching
              slowly with neck straight and bill angled slightly downward. Female
              ceases activity and turns away in silence, lowering head slightly,
              gradually bending legs, extending wings horizontally, lowering neck,
              and angling bill perpendicular to ground, lying almost flat on ground.
              Male steps onto female's back, bends legs and elevates wings for
              balance, and depresses tail. Male sometimes pecks at female's neck
              or scapular region, or grasps neck at base of head, sometimes twisting
              head slightly to one side. Cloacal contact lasts about 3 s and entire
              mounting lasts =60 s. Male dismounts over female's head or to side.
              After dismounting, both usually engage in such activities as brief
              calling, tail-shaking, feather-ruffling, preening, wing-flicking,
              probing, or stretching (Ingalls 1972). Displacement-nesting activity,
              specifically vegetation-tossing by male and female, also observed
              (N. Snyder pers. comm., in Ingalls 1972).</font></font></p>
            <p>Female's desertion of family unit usually occurs 1-5 wk after young
              are in downy stage, when female starts to forage and rest in distant
              parts of territory. Some pair bonds persist over several seasons.
              Male continues to care for young. Female desertion especially quick
              after heavy mortality of downy young, but females also seen to desert
              when up to 4 young still surviving in brood. After wandering, female
              may return to same male for second mating. </p>

              &times; 43.98 (range 41.72-45.80); mass of 57.4 g (Walkinshaw 1982).
              Ground color buff; 2 types noted: light grayish white and buffy
              brown, shades varying but never light and dark within set (Nicholson
              1928). Blotched and streaked markings, especially heavy at large
              end, of brown and purplish gray. Overall average 5.5 eggs/clutch.</p>
            <p>Both parents incubate during daytime; only female incubates at
              night (Bryan 1981). </p>
            <p>Juveniles fly by age 7 wk (Ingalls 1972). Young stay in close group
              while still being fed by parents. By weeks 8-10, juveniles begin
              to wander to separate places, although still somewhat grouped within
              parents' territory. At weeks 11-13, juvenile males become target
              of increasing parental aggression, leave sibling group, and assume
              well-defined subterritories within parents' territory. Subterritories
              usually stable until dispersal. Juvenile females, by contrast, are
              characteristically silent and unaggressive, range throughout parents'
              territory, forage and rest longer near parents (especially adult
              male), and disperse later (Bryan 1981, 1996a). First brood may stay
              in parents' territory while second brood is young or may be driven
              out (Ingalls 1972).Male juveniles leave parents' territory 13-17
              wk after hatching, depending on parental pressure (Bryan 1981, Walkinshaw
              1982). </p>
            <p>Both males and females breed successfully near end of first year
              (as early as 44 wk old). Prolonged courtship and subsequent desertion
              sometimes occur in first attempt of 1-yr-old birds (Bryan 1981).
              Number of clutches/breeding season 1-3; frequencies of each not
              reported. Second clutches often laid soon after parental care stops
              for first brood at about week 10.</p>

            <p>Resident of open freshwater marshes, riparian swamp forests (especially

            <p>In Florida, 1920s drainage of many parts of Everglades and southwest
              shore of Lake Okeechobee eliminated several formerly abundant populations(Birds
              of No Am).</p>
            <p>Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission estimated population
              by creating map of potential habitat and using 2 density estimates
              (5-10 territories/km2 for forested wetland systems and 2.5-5 territories/km2
              for open wetland systems); this estimated statewide population of
              3,000-6,000 territories in current conservation areas, which represented
              49% of all potential wetland habitat (Cox et al. 1994).</p>
            <p>Once abundant throughout the Florida Peninsula but almost extirpated
              in accessible regions by hunting for food (Bent 1926). Overhunting
              steadily decreased populations described as "very abundant" in 1860s
              to "decidedly scarce" 40 yr later.By 1954, Florida population strengths
              were Wakulla Springs, Kissimmee River valley to western shore of
              Lake Okeechobee; also a building population in the Everglades around
              Paradise Key (Sprunt 1954). </p>
            <p>Population losses due to wetland conversion in Florida not documented,
              but must have been large. Over half of wetlands within central and
              s. Florida lost during last century; remainder highly fragmented
              and severely degraded. Wading-bird populations reduced to &lt;10%
              of former size (Weaver and Brown 1993). Beginning in early 1900s,
              and accelerating in 1940s and 1950s, farmers and developers diked
              and drained thousands of acres of broad marshy headwaters of northward-flowing
              St. Johns River. To the west, the southward-flowing Kissimmee-Okeechobee-Ever-glades
              drainage basin was also manipulated by works of Everglades Drainage
              District and Okeechobee Flood Control District. However, these efforts
              were dwarfed during 1950s and 1960s when U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
              greatly accelerated large-scaled drainage with 46,600-km2 Central
              and Southern Florida Project for Flood Control. By 1972, about 70%
              of historical 164,000-ha Upper St. Johns River Marsh was converted
              to agricultural fields (Sterling and Padera 1998). Almost half the
              historic 1.2 million-ha greater Everglades wetland system was also
              drained for agriculture and development (Davis et al. 1994). Because
              of these water diversions, marsh drydowns became more frequent and
              longer in duration and were blamed for suppressing apple-snail populations
              (Kushlan 1975).</p>
            <p>Water-level manipulations continue to be a problem. At Lake Okeechobee,
              whose western littoral zone is particularly important Limpkin habitat,
              wading-bird populations have dropped 70% since the 1980s and submergent
              plant communities were reduced by 70% during the 1990s. Pollution
              of freshwater habitats may also be a problem. Much of the water
              now flowing into the Everglades originates as agricultural runoff
              from citrus groves and sugarcane fields. Apple-snail habitat in
              rivers and lakes also has been degraded by invasive exotic aquatic
              plants that locally replace native plant populations. </p>
            <p>Listed as Species of Special Concern by Florida Fish and Wildlife
              Conservation Commission. The Florida Natural Areas Inventory lists
              it G5 (demonstrably globally secure) and S3 (in Florida either very
              rare and local throughout range [21-100 occurrences or &lt;10,000
              individuals] or found locally in very restricted range or vulnerable
              to extinction from other factors; Marois 1999). Several factors
              suggest species may continue to be vulnerable in U.S.it is relatively
              uncommon in small range, wholly dependent on certain riparian habitats,
              and largely dependent on a single prey species. The Snail Kite,
              another apple-snail specialist, also once ranged to Wakulla Springs
              (Howell 1932), but is now reduced to s. Florida and listed as Endangered.
              Nevertheless, Limpkin does not seem to be in immediate danger and
              will probably remain locally common where apple snails are abundant.</p>
            <p>Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission has proposed
              additional habitat protection. Commission staff used estimates of
              territory size in 2 habitat types (forested riverine wetlands and
              open wetlands) and calculated acreage of potential habitat from
              LANDSAT imagery. Analysis determined that approximately 1,981 km2
              of potential habitat for Limpkins exist throughout Florida, of which
              49% occurs within current conservation areas. Conservation-area
              habitat suggested 4 potentially secure populations (&gt;100 territories),
              11 insecure populations (25-100 territories), and &gt;30 imperiled
              populations (&lt;25 territories). Four largest populations in current
              conservation areas are in: (1) Everglades (including Everglades
              National Park, water-conservation areas, Big Cypress National Preserve,
              Fakahatchee Strand Preserve State Park, and Loxahatchee National
              Wildlife Refuge [NWR]); (2) water-management district lands along
              western edge of Lake Okeechobee; (3) forested wetlands on and near
              Ocala National Forest (including Lake Woodruff NWR and Cross-Florida
              Greenway lands); and (4) water management-district lands along upper
              St. Johns River. Analysis concluded that current conservation areas
              appear insufficient to provide minimum habitat for Limpkins (enough
              to support at least 10 populations of 200 individuals each) and
              that more habitat area should be conserved by acquisition and/or
              regulation. Increased efforts proposed to: (1) expand those conservation
              areas holding insecure populations; (2) create new noncontiguous
              conservation areas where habitat occurs; and (3) create new noncontiguous
              conservation areas where concentrations of breeding bird-atlas records
              occur. Additional Strategic Habitat Conservation Areas for suites
              of rare species, including Limpkin, have also been identified for
              public acquisition (Cox et al. 1994).</p>
            <p>No significant conservation measures taken specifically for Limpkin,
              although it certainly benefited in the past from wading bird anti-shooting
              campaigns and general bird protection legislation. More recently,
              the large-scaled wetland conversions have now stopped (see Effects
              of human activity, above) and wetland-restoration efforts are increasing.The
              most far-reaching effort will be the 35-yr, US$8 billion Comprehensive
              Everglades Restoration Plan led by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
              which includes more than 65 projects that will restore about 972,000
              ha of the wetland's ecosystem. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The Limpkin is known to breed successfully only where substantial
              apple-snail populations occur. Apple-snail ecology, habitat use,
              water-quality needs, distribution, and conservation status remain
              poorly known and should be determined throughout Florida. This information
              should guide management practices that affect those habitats, including
              hydroperiod, prescribed fire, aquatic-weed control, and nutrient
              loading. Continued research is needed for effective control of invasive
              exotic plants, which threaten some apple-snail habitats. Research
              is also needed to improve regulations to prevent new invasive exotic
              threats, which might eventually include uncontrollable predators
              and diseases of the apple snail.</p>
