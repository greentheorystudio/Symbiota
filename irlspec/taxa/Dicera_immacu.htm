   <p class="title">Species Description</p>
              <p class="body"><em>Dicerandra immaculata</em> is a rare and
              endangered species of mint that grows to a height of approximately
              50 cm (1.6 feet). Young plants and those growing
              in open sunlight have an erect growth habit and may form dense mats,
              while older plants and ones growing in shaded areas are arching
              or sprawling. Leaves are opposite (but may appear to
              be whorled) and linear to narrowly oblong in shape, with inrolled
              margins and rounded tips (FNAI 2006; Nelson 1996).
              Leaves measure 1.5 - 3 cm (0.6 - 1.2 inches) in length and 2 - 4
              mm (0.07 - 0.16 inches) in width. Both the upper and lower
              surfaces of the leaves are covered with fine dots. Flowers
              are two-lipped and tubular in shape, measuring 1.5 - 2 cm (0.6 - 0.8 inches) in length. Color ranges from pink
              to rose or lavender, and there
              are no spots on the petals, a trait that differs from most other
              <em>Dicerandra</em> species. Anthers are white, and extend
              beyond the flower. Stamens are spurred.
              The inflorescence is 15-25 cm (5.9 - 9.8 inches) long and has overlapping
              cymes, each bearing 1,3 or 5 flowers (Kral
              1982) in leaf axils. Fruit is a pale-colored, rounded
              nutlet approximately 1mm (0.04 inches) in length.</p>

            <p class="title">Potentially Misidentified Species</p>
              <p class="body"><em>Dicerandra immaculata </em> is distinguished from the other
              4 <em>Dicerandra</em> species that occur in Florida by their flowers,
              which, as suggested by the scientific name, are immaculate, or lacking
              in spots.</p>

  	<p class="heading">HABITAT AND DISTRIBUTION</p>
    <p class="title">Regional Occurrence</p>
              <p class="body"><em>Dicerandra immaculata</em> is extremely rare and endemic to
              the Atlantic Coastal Ridge of Florida.&nbsp;It was first described
              in 1963 (Lakela 1963), and known to occur naturally only in coastal
              scrub and pine scrub areas in Indian River and St. Lucie Counties,
              with most known plants in an area of old dune with an elevation
              of 45 feet. This area is approximately 1/2 mile wide and 3
              miles long, lying between Vero Beach and Ft. Pierce (USFWS 1999).
              An experimental population was introduced into Hobe Sound National
              Wildlife Refuge in Martin County in 1991 and 1992 (Race 1994).
             </p>
            <p class="title">IRL Distribution</p>
              <p class="body">The bulk of the <em>Dicerandra immaculata</em> population lies on
              remnant Pleistocene dunes between Vero Beach and Ft. Pierce, FL.
              Until recently, no populations occurred in protected areas (USFWS
              1999).</p>

   		<p class="heading">LIFE HISTORY AND POPULATION BIOLOGY</p>
      <p class="title">Age, Size, Lifespan</p>
              <p class="body">Lakela's mint grows to approximately
              50 cm (1.6 feet) in height. Leaves measure 1.5 - 3 cm (0.6
              - 1.2 inches) in length and 2 - 4 mm (0.07 - 0.16 inches) in width.&nbsp;Flowers
              are two-lipped and tubular in shape, measuring&nbsp;1.5
              - 2 cm (0.6 - 0.8 inches) in length. </p>
            <p class="title">Abundance</p>
              <p class="body"><em>Dicerandra immaculata</em> is extremely rare and endemic to
              a tiny range that extends over 2 Florida Counties (USFWS 1999; Nelson
              1996).</p>
            <p class="title">Reproduction</p>
              <p class="body">New
              leaves emerge from February through August. Lakela's
              mint is documented to bloom sporadically throughout the year, with
              peaks in September - November (FNAI 2006). It only reproduces
              through seedlings and requires insect pollinators, though which
              specific species of insects actually pollinate this plant is unknown.
               However, it produces spurred anthers, which require an insect
              to trigger them before pollen is dispersed (USFWS 1999; Nelson 1996).
              Fruiting occurs from October
              to December, and sporadically through the year (Austin et al 1980).</p>

            <p class="body"><em>Dicerandra immaculata </em> apparently
              has limited seed dispersal. Race (1994) reported that the
              experimental population, introduced to two sites in Hobe Sound National
              Wildlife Refuge in 1991 and 1992, had spread no more than 2m (6.6
              feet) from the original parent population. As
              of 1994, 1/3 of the original plants survived at first site, and
              1/2 survived at the second. Both sites contained new seedlings.
               As of 1997, the first site continued to produce new seedlings;
              plants at the second site were flowering; and most newer plants
              had become well established (USFWS 1999). Based on monitoring
              of this population, Race (1994) suggested that plants grew best
              when planted in the cooler spring months, and when not irrigated,
              as irrigation promoted the growth of competing species.</p>

   	<p class="heading">COMMUNITY ECOLOGY</p>
   	<p class="title">Competitors</p>
              <p class="body"><em>Dicerandra immaculata </em>competes for space with other scrub
              species, most likely saw palmetto (<em>Serenoa repens</em>) and
              other understory plants that colonize open gaps in scrub areas (USFWS
              1999).</p>
            <p class="title">Habitats</p>
              <p class="body"><em>Dicerandra immaculata</em> is found in open
              scrub, sand pine scrub, and sandhills on remnants of old coastal
              dunes. Optimum
              habitats are open &quot;gap&quot; areas in scrub having varying
              degrees of cover, from bare sands to areas littered with other species
              growing nearby. Growth is most vigorous in sun or lightly
              shaded areas, but
              plants become weak and sprawling as woody species and shrubs such
              as saw palmetto (<em>Serenoa repens</em>) become established in
              open areas (Nelson 1996; USFWS 1999).</p>
            <p class="body">Specific substrate
              types are white or yellow sands (St. Lucie,
              Paola, and Astatula) that are deep and acidic, occurring
              on high dune-like ridges (USFWS 1999).</p>
            <p class="title">Associated Species</p>
              <p class="body">The essential oils of
              Lakela's mint protect it from most herbivory by insects (USFWS 1999).
              It is subject to mildew that grows on nectary glands. Mildew
              infection destroy fruits and the viability of seeds before seeds
              can be dispersed (Austin et al. 1980).</p>

     <p class="heading">ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>
     <p class="title">Special Status</p>
              <p class="body"><em>Dicerandra immaculata</em> has been Federally
              listed as an Endangered Species since
              July 23, 1984. It was originally listed due to its extremely
              limited range and because of the rate in which its primary habitat
              along the Atlantic Coastal Ridge was being rapidly developed for
              commercial and residential uses.</p>
            <p class="body">The State of Florida lists
              <em>Dicerandra immaculata</em> as Endangered.
              However, under Florida law, endangered plants on privately held
              land are considered the property of the owner, and are thus subject
              to removal when land is sold for development. Until recently, the
              only protected population of this species was experimentally introduced
              in 1991 and 1992 to two sites in Hobe Sound National Wildlife Refuge
              in Martin County, an area outside the species' original, limited,
              range.</p>
            <p class="body">The Florida Natural Areas
              Inventory (FNAI) considers <em>Dicerandra immaculata</em> to be
              critically imperiled (5 or fewer occurrences, or a total of less
              than 1000 individuals), both because it is a rare endemic with a
              limited range, and because coastal development is encroaching on
              the few, highly fragmented populations in existence.</p>

            <p class="title">Management issues</p>
              <p class="body">Management efforts are ongoing to monitor and protect existing populations,
              to purchase environmentally sensitive lands, to enforce current
              protections, and to learn more about the ecology of <em>Dicerandra
              immaculata.&nbsp;</em></p>
            <p class="body">The management plan for
              <em>D. immaculata</em> recommends prescribed burning as an important
              conservation measure that both rejuvenates existing plants, and
              also maintains the quality of the limited habitat by removing understory
              plants in open scrub, thus reducing competition with other species
              (USFWS 1999). To date, however, the optimum level of prescribed
              burning has not been established (USFWS 1999). </p>
            <p class="body">Continuation of
              <em>ex situ</em> conservation conservation efforts like those ongoing
              at Hobe Sound are also recommended in the USFWS (1999) management
              plan.  The plan further recommends conservation of <em>D.
              immaculata</em> germ plasm by long-term seed stage. Additionally,
               more rigorous enforcement of protective measures already
              being undertaken, such as prohibition of offroad vehicle use in
              <em>Dicerandra </em>areas, and prohibiting cutting or transplanting
              of existing plants, is also recommended.</p>
            <p class="body">St. Lucie County
              has purchased environmentally sensitive lands where Lakela's mint
              grows in order to protect existing plants and to reintroduce Lakela's
              mint to suitable areas.  Two such purchases were a 23-acre site of scrubland, and a 296-acre remnant
              of the Atlantic Coastal Ridge.  Both sites were within the
              3-mile historical range of Lakela's mint, and border U.S. Highway
              1. These sites were surveyed and found to harbor small populations
              of <em>Dicerandra immaculata</em>. The County has been working
              with area botanical gardens to monitor existing plants and introduce
              new plants to these areas.</p>
