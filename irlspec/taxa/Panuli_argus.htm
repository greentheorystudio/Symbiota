              <p class="title">Species Description</p>
              <p class="body">The carapace of <em>Panulirus argus</em> is subcylindrical and bears
              many strong, forward-facing spines. A pair of rostral horns projects
              forward over the stalked eyes. Whip-like antennae are longer than
              the body and are studded with small spines and setae. Antennules
              are also elongate, extending approximately 2/3 body length. The
              abdomen is notched along its lateral margins, but is otherwise smooth.
              Each segment of the abdomen has a transverse groove that is disrupted
              at the midline. The central telson is flanked by 2 pairs of biramous
              uropods. Body color is varied, but is generally a gray or tan base
              color mottled with shades of green, red, brown, purple, or black.
              The second and sixth segments of the abdomen have large yellow or
              white ocelli, with smaller ocelli scattered dorsolaterally along
              the abdomen. Legs are striped longitudinally in a dull blue color.
              Dactyls of the walking legs are setose. Pleopods are bright orange
              and black. The endopodites in female pleopods are well developed
              and hook-like, bearing many setae. In juveniles, antennae and pereopods
              are banded with white; and a broad white stripe runs the length
              of the dorsal midline across both the carapace and abdomen.</p>
              
            <p class="body"><em>Panulirus argus</em> is sexually dimorphic,
              with females distinguished from males by differences in the sternum,
              legs and genital openings. In males, the sternum is somewhat broader
              and lacks the striations that are commonly found in females. The
              second pair of walking legs in males is more elongate than the other
              legs, and bears longer, curved dactyls. Females have small chelae
              on the dactyls of the fifth pair of walking legs. The raised genital
              openings of males are located ventrally, on the bases of the fifth
              pair of walking legs. In females, the gonopores are set at the bases
              of the third pair of walking legs. </p>

              <p class="title">Potentially Misidentified Species</p>
                <p class="body"><em>Panulirus argus</em> closely resembles a related species, the
                smoothtail spiny lobster, <em>P. laevicauda</em>, whose range is
                sympatric. The two are easily distinguished based on 2 characters:
                <em>P. laevicauda</em> lacks dorsal grooves on abdomen, but possesses
                a series of small white spots that run along the lateral margins
                of the abdomen.</p>

  	<p class="heading">HABITAT AND DISTRIBUTION</p>
    <p class="title">Regional Occurrence</p>
              <p class="body">Spiny lobsters occur from North Carolina south to Brazil including
              Bermuda, the Gulf of Mexico, West Indies and Caribbean. The northernmost
              extent of the range is North Carolina (Williams 1984). </p>
              
            <p class="title">IRL Distribution</p>
              <p class="body">Adults are most prevalent in nearshore and offshore waters, but
              are found throughout the Indian River Lagoon in areas where there
              is ample shelter. Juveniles commonly occur in seagrasses, mangrove
              creeks and oyster reefs. </p>

   		<p class="heading">LIFE HISTORY AND POPULATION BIOLOGY</p>
      <p class="title">Age, Size, Lifespan</p>
              <p class="body"><em>Panulirus argus</em> reaches a maximum length of approximately
              45 cm (1.47 feet), but is more commonly found at lengths of approximately
              20 cm (7.9 inches). Growth in the first year averages 5 cm (1.5
              inches), with growth thereafter averaging approximately 2.5 cm (1
              inch) per year. Male and female growth rates are approximately equal
              in south Florida nursery areas (Davis and Dodrill 1980). Females
              tend to grow somewhat more slowly than males (Little 1972; Olsen
              and Koblick 1975) and do not achieve as large a size (Williams 1984).</p>
            <p class="body">Spiny lobsters molt an average of 2.5 times
              per year, with most molting occurring from March - July, or from
              December - February in Florida (Williams 1984). Growth characteristics
              are correlated with age, with molt frequency and increment of growth
              at molting tending to decline with age (Aiken 1980). Variability
              in food quality and abundance, population density, water temperature,
              as well as rates of predation and injury, all affect growth rates
              in local populations. </p>
            <p class="body">Eldred et al. (1972) estimated average growth
              rates in wild populations of <em>Panulirus argus</em> as 5 mm (0.2
              inches) per month for the first 9 -10 months post-settlement in
              Biscayne Bay, Florida. Tagging studies in the same area showed that
              mean growth rates in 40-85 mm (1.6 - 3.3 inches) lobsters averaged
              1.8 mm (0.07 inches) per month, with physical condition having a
              significant impact on growth rates. Davis (1981) reported that individuals
              having no injuries grew approximately 2.2 mm (0.09 inches) per month,
              while those missing legs and antennae grew only 1.3 mm (0.05 inches)
              per month. In Florida Bay, however, growth rates for injured and
              uninjured lobsters were approximately equal, at 3.3 mm (0.12 inches)
              per month (Davis and Dodrill 1980). In Key West, tagged lobsters
              49 - 83 mm (1.9 - 3.3 inches) in length grew approximately 3.1 mm
              (0.12 inches) per month (Little 1972).</p>
            <p class="body">Witham et al. (1968) reared pueruli of<em>
              Panulirus argus</em> under laboratory conditions over 7 months.
              During this time pueruli averaging 6 mm (0.2 inches) carapace length
              (CL) grew to an average of 34 mm (1.33 inches), with growth rates
              ranging from 3.8 - 4.2 mm (0.14 - 0.16 inches) per month. Other
              laboratory populations grew considerably more slowly, with Lewis
              et al. (1952) and Sweat (1968) reporting monthly growth rates less
              than 2 mm (0.07 inches) per month. </p>
            <p class="body">Assuming a post-settlement growth rate of
              4.0 mm (0.16 inches) per month, <em>Panulirus argus</em> likely
              reaches legal harvest size in 20 - 40 months, depending on location
              and degree of injury (Little 1972; Davis and Dodrill 1980).</p>
              
            <p class="title">Reproduction</p>
              <p class="body"><em>Panulirus argus</em> reach sexual maturity at lengths of approximately
              70 - 80 mm (2.8 - 3.2 inches) (Witham et al 1968. Olsen et al 1975,
              Davis 1979). Adult male and females often inhabit estuaries, bays,
              and lagoons; but spawning typically occurs in nearshore and offshore
              reef fringes and other hardbottom areas from late spring through
              summer in Florida waters (Davis 1975; Kanciruk and Herrnkind 1976;
              Lyons et al. 1981). Annual variation in peak spawning period is
              dependent on water temperature. Lyons et al. (1981) reported spawning
              begins when water temperatures reach 24&ordm; C in deeper reef areas.
              In Florida, there is little evidence that spiny lobsters spawn more
              than once per year; however, in Bermuda, evidence supports multiple
              spawning (Sutcliffe 1952). </p>
            <p class="body">Mating follows short courtships that involve
              signals being given by both sexes. In copulation, males hold females
              sternum to sternum and extrude a spermatophore which is adhered
              to the female's sternum, and will remain until the time of spawning.
              Sperm may be viable for as long as a month (Marx and Herrnkind 1986).
              Spawning occurs when females flex the abdomen under the carapace,
              spreading the telson and uropods, as well as the pleopods. Eggs
              are shed onto the abdomen, while the female scratches at the spermatophore
              to liberate sperm and fertilize eggs as they are extruded. </p>
            <p class="body">Fecundity varies with body size. Females
              71-75 mm (2.8 - 3 inches) in length carry approximately 230,000
              eggs; while females over 100 mm (3.9 inches) carry more than 700,000
              eggs (Mota-Alves and Bezerra 1968). Williams (1984) reported females
              23 cm (9.1 inches) with 500,000 eggs, 30 cm (11.8 inches) with 1.18
              million eggs, and 38 cm (15 inches) with 2.6 million eggs. </p>
            <p class="body">Using the Index of Reproductive Potential
              (IRP) Lyons et al. (1981) estimated that female <em>Panulirus argus</em>
              in the upper Florida Keys measuring 76-85 mm (3.0 - 3.3 inches)
              carapace length (CL) contribute 48% of all egg production in the
              population. Females over 85 mm (3.3 inches) CL comprise approximately
              20% of the female population, but contribute 41% of egg production.
              Females smaller than 76 mm (3.0 inches) comprise approximately 25%
              of all females, but contribute 11 % of all eggs. </p>
            <p class="body">Minimum spawning size has declined in Florida
              <em>Panulirus argus</em> females, perhaps as a response to intense
              fishing pressures. In 1922, minimum spawning size of females was
              reported to be 76mm (3.0 inches) (Crawford and De Schmidt 1922).
              Recent surveys have revealed reproductive females as small as 65
              mm - 71 mm (2.6 - 2.8 inches) in south Florida (Warner et al. 1977;
              Lyons et al 1981). However, unfished populations in the Dry Tortugas
              area show the minimum size in egg-bearing females to be 78 mm (3.1
              inches) (Davis 1975). Suggested reasons for this decline in minimum
              spawning size have been genetic selection; modified sexual behavior
              when large females become rare; and reduced growth rates (Davis
              1975; Warner et al. 1977; Lyons et al 1981). Decline in size of
              mature females has caused a marked reduction in reproductive potential,
              with Lyons et al. (1981) estimating that egg production in Florida
              Keys spiny lobsters was only 12% of that expected from a similarly
              sized, unfished population (Lyons et al. 1981).</p>
              
            <p class="title">Embryology</p>
              <p class="body">Eggs are bright orange in color and measure approximately 0.5 mm
              (0.02 inches) In diameter. Upon being extruded, eggs adhere to hook-like
              setae of pleopods located on the underside of the abdomen. They
              will remain in place until hatching at approximately 3 weeks. Several
              days before hatching occurs, eggs turn a darker brown color. Eggs
              hatch as transparent phyllosome larvae and are dispersed into the
              water column by repeated flexing of the female's abdomen. A second,
              smaller spawning may occur in Caribbean and West Indies populations
              about 1 week after release of eggs, though there is no evidence
              that a second spawning occurs in Florida waters. Following a second
              spawning, the ovary is usually spent, and the spermatophore erodes.
              Molting typically occurs after spawning. (William 1984). </p>
            <p class="body">Phyllosomes are transparent and morphologically
              adapted for long planktonic existence being transported on oceanic
              currents for 6-12 months before metamorphosis to the postlarval
              stage (Lyons et al 1981). Phyllosomes are dorsoventrally flattened
              and have a bi-lobed cephalothorax. Appendages are long and setose
              to assist in floatation in the water column. Swimming is accomplished
              by flexion in the exopodites of the legs (Provenzano 1968). Phyllosomes
              vertically migrate on a daily basis, ascending to surface waters
              at night, and descending during the day (Sims and Ingle 1967). There
              are 11 stages of phyllosome development. During this period, larval
              size increases from 2 mm (0.07 inches) total length (TL) at hatching
              to approximately 34 mm (1.3 inches) before the metamorphosis to
              the postlarval puerulus stage. </p>
            <p class="body">Pueruli persist for several weeks, are nonfeeding
              and oceanic (Lyons 1980). Like phyllosomes, they are dorsoventrally
              flattened and transparent, with no calcification in the carapace.
              Pueruli return to coastal waters from offshore, swimming shoreward
              at night, and tending to remain within a few centimeters of the
              water surface (Lyons 1980). Pueruli enter estuarine habitats throughout
              the year, with peaks occurring during new and first-quarter moons
              (Sweat 1968; Little and Milano 1980). Peak recruitment varies from
              year to year, but the main peak typically occurs in spring, followed
              by a lesser peak in the fall (Lyons 1980). </p>
            <p class="body">Upon encountering suitable inshore substrates,
              pueruli settle to the benthos, typically in vegetated areas of algal
              beds, mangrove areas where prop roots are fouled by algae, seagrasses,
              small holes, and sand-mud bottoms (Witham et al 1964). Several days
              before the molt to the first juvenile stage, they begin to show
              signs of pigmentation, turning a red-brown color. Benthic juveniles
              are cryptically colored in varying shades, and have banding and
              striping that aids in camouflage. Young juveniles tend to be solitary
              and behave aggressively toward conspecifics, lashing them with antennae,
              or prying at them to dislodge them from refuges (Marx and Herrnkind
              1986). However, an ontogenetic shift occurs to more social, gregarious
              behavior as body size increases. This shift appears to be at least
              partially dependent on the distribution and quality of shelters
              available (Marx and Herrnkind 1986). </p>

    <p class="title">Temperature</p>
              <p class="body"><em>Panulirus argus</em> are generally found where minimum monthly
              water temperatures exceed 20 &ordm;C (68 &ordm;F) (George and Main
              1967). Optimal growth occurs in temperatures of 26 - 28&ordm;C (Marx
              and Herrnkind 1986). While postlarvae tolerate short-term temperature
              declines to 13 &ordm;C (55.4 &ordm;F) (Little and Milano 1980),
              they have been found to grow more slowly and experience higher mortalities
              when temperatures are sustained below 16 &ordm;C (60.8&ordm;F) (Witham
              1974). Rapid decline to water temperatures below 10 &ordm;C (50.0
              &ordm;F), especially in molting lobsters, may cause death (Marx
              and Herrnkind 1986).</p>
            <p class="body">Rapid growth with poor survival has been
              often observed at water temperatures exceeding 32 &ordm;C (89.6
              &ordm;F) (Witham 1974; Aiken 1980).</p>

            <p class="title">Salinity</p>
              <p class="body">Postlarvae do not tolerate salinity below 19 parts per thousand

	<p class="title">Trophic Mode</p>
              <p class="body">The diet of phyllosome larvae is not well described; however, those
              in culture consume chaetognaths, euphausids, fish larvae, and ctenophores
              (Provenzano 1968; Phillips and Sastry 1980). Pueruli are non-feeding
              (Lyons 1980). Benthic juveniles and adults are foragers that utilize
              chemoreceptive setae lining the antennules and walking legs assist
              in locating food sources (Ache and Macmillan 1980). </p>
            <p class="body"><em>Panulirus argus</em> are often the dominant
              carnivores within their habitats, and likely effect the population
              sizes of other benthic species (Berry and Smale 1980). Typical prey
              items include a variety of slow-moving or sedentary organisms including
              gastropods, bivalves, crustaceans, annelids and echinoderms. Shelled
              organisms are manipulated with the legs and positioned near the
              mouth, where powerful mandibles can then crush or chip shells to
              extract prey.</p>
              
            <p class="title">Competitors</p>
              <p class="body">Competition among
              lobster species in Florida is thought to be of little consequence
              as Panulirus argus is the dominant lobster species in Florida. A
              congener, P. laevicauda, though sympatric, is relatively scarce
              and generally found only in reef habitats (Marx and Herrnkind 1986);
              thus, little competition likely occurs.</p>
              
            <p class="title">Predators</p>
              <p class="body"><em>Panulirus argus</em> larvae are consumed by a variety of pelagic
              fish species (Phillips and Sastry 1980). Pueruli are consumed by
              fishes as well as by benthic and epibenthic organisms such as crabs
              and octopods (Little and Milano 1980). Later juveniles and adults
              are armoured against predators both by their spiny exoskeletons
              and by their behaviors, with rapid tail-flipping the most commonly
              observed escape response. Spiny lobsters also resist predation by
              congregating together in shelters and blocking den openings (Lipcius
              et al. 1983).</p>
            <p class="body">Large predators of juvenile and adult spiny
              lobsters include groupers (especially goliath groupers) (Crawford
              and De Smidt 1922), sharks, loggerhead turtles, and octopods (Kanciruk
              1980). </p>
              
            <p class="title">Habitats</p>
              <p class="body">Spiny lobsters are gregarious and migratory, most commonly found
              in coastal and shallow continental waters to depths of 90 m (295
              feet) or more. The life cycle consists of 5 phases, each of which
              is habitat-associated. The oceanic, planktonic stage is characterized
              by the phyllosome larva. Phyllosomes inhabit the epipelagic zone
              of open ocean waters where temperature and salinity are relatively
              constant. Optimum survival occurs when conditions are stable and
              nonturbid, with no environmental pollutants. The swimming postlarval
              stage is characterized by the puerulus postlarva, which utilizes
              a broad range of nearshore and estuarine habitats, but settles primarily
              in well-vegetated habitats such as seagrasses meadows and algal
              beds. Algae, particularly the red alga Laurenia spp., appear to
              be especially important to newly settled postlarvae. The early benthic
              stage is characterized by the banded coloration pattern in young
              juveniles, which utilize mangrove creeks and vegetated shallow water.
              The late juvenile stage occurs in older juveniles, which utilize
              seagrasses and oyster reefs for as much as 2 years before migrating
              as sub-adults to shallow banks in nearshore waters. The adult stage
              is characterized by mature adults, which utilize hardbottom, patch
              reefs and coral reefs (Marx and Herrnkind 1986), commonly using
              crevices in coral reefs, overhangs, outcroppings, and other hard
              substrates for shelter. Adults use softbottom habitats and seagrasses
              primarily during migratory periods (Herrnkind et al 1975; Kanciruk
              1980). </p>
            <p class="body">Though adults often inhabit bays and estuarine
              habitats, they do not typically spawn there. Spawning occurs offshore
              in sheltered areas having low turbidity, low wave action and adequate
              larval transport by currents and waves (Kanciruk and Hernnkind 1976).
              </p>
            <p class="body">Lobsters longer than 20 mm aggregate in shelters
              within protected bays and high salinity estuaries (Olsen et al.
              1975; Davis 1979). Typical shelters include sponges, corals, mangrove
              roots, holes, rocky outcrops, and ledges. Davis (1971) reported
              juvenile spiny lobsters taking shelter under sea urchins. At approximately
              70-80 mm, at the onset of sexual maturity, lobsters begin the migration
              to nearshore and offshore reefs. More females than males migrate
              offshore, with females tending to migrate into deeper waters in
              spring and summer for mating and larval release (Lyons et al. 1981).
              Both sexes migrate offshore in fall and winter months as severe
              fall storms arrive and water temperatures begin to decrease (Davis
              1977; Herrnkind 1982). On occasion, mass migration of spiny lobster
              occurs, with lobsters forming single-file lines that stretch long
              distances (Kanciruk and Herrnkind 1978; Marx and Herrnkind 1986).
              </p>
            <p class="body">Offshore populations consist primarily of
              adults that live communally or singly in crevices of rocks and corals,
              with most lobsters showing high site fidelity (Herrnkind et al.
              1975). Spiny lobsters are relatively selective when choosing den
              sites and show a preference for those that allow complete concealment,
              exclude large predators, and contain other lobsters (Herrnkind et
              al 1975). </p>
              
            <p class="title">Activity Time</p>
              <p class="body">Juveniles and adults are primarily nocturnal, with juveniles being
              somewhat more nomadic (Marx and Herrnkind 1986).</p>

              <p class="body"><b>Commercial Fishery</b><br>
              The statewide commercial catch of spiny lobsters is the second most
              valuable Florida shell fishery, second only to shrimp. Since 1970,
              the commercial catch has ranged without trend between 4.3 million
              - 7.9 million pounds per year (Muller 2003).</p>
              <p class="body">Between
              1987 - 2001, the commercial harvest of <em>Panulirus argus </em>
              in Florida totaled 94.6 million pounds, and was valued at $365.3
              million. Most landings occur on the Gulf coast and in Monroe and Dade counties
              on the East coast. Generally less than 1.5 million pounds of spiny
              lobsters are landed outside the vicinity of the Florida Keys each
              year (Muller 2003), and this is reflected in the relatively low
              annual value of the spiny lobster catch to IRL counties. Commercial
              lobstermen using traps account for approximately 80% of the total
              catch, with recreational divers harvesting 20%.</p>
              <p class="body">The 5 county area encompassing the IRL (Volusia, Brevard, Indian River,
              St. Lucie and Martin Counties) accounted for 607,890 pound of the
              commercial harvest, which had a value of $2.3 million. This ranks
              the spiny lobster twenty-third in commercial value to IRL counties,
              and forty-fourth in pounds harvested. </p></p>
            <p class="body">Figure 1 below shows the
              dollar value of the spiny lobster commercial fishery to IRL counties
              by year. The fishery ranged in value from a high of $260,838 in
              2001, to a low of $68,113 in 1988. Brevard County accounted for
              the largest share of the catch at 53.3%, followed distantly by Martin
              (15.3%), St. Lucie (13.3%),Volusia (13.2%) and Indian River(4.9%)

              Beginning in 1991, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission
              began utilizing mail surveys to estimate the recreational harvests
              of spiny lobster by recreational fishers during the 2-day mid-summer
              sport season, and the regular season, which opens in early August
              and runs through late March. In a typical year, the recreational
              harvest of spiny lobsters averages 20 - 22% of the commercial catch
              with approximately 2 million pounds of lobster harvested (Eaken
              2001).</p>
            <p class="body">Harvest regulations for spiny
              lobsters state the carapace must be longer than 3 inches as measured
              from the groove between eyes to the end of carapace. Recreational
              harvesting requires a saltwater fishing license. Recreational anglers
              must measure lobsters in the water and immediately release undersized
              animals and females with eggs. The bag limit in most areas is 6
              lobsters per person per day.</p>
