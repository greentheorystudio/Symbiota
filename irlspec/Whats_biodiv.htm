    <td> <p class="title">The Problem: Loss of Species</p>
      <p class="body">By the early 1980s, scientists around the world
        had begun to recognize that species extinctions were occurring on a global
        scale. The rate of these extinctions rivaled, or surpassed, those of the
        Cretaceous period 65 million years ago when many species, including the dinosaurs became extinct. The crisis facing species today differs in one
        fundamental way from any other extinction events: all other cases of mass
        extinction throughout global history have come about as the result of
        climatic change, a natural geological change or some cataclysmic event.
        The present crisis, however, is being driven by human influences.
        Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, the scientific community, the media,
        the public, and governmental agencies worldwide began working
        to preserve the biological diversity of terrestrial systems. Issues
        such as deforestation of tropical forests, overdevelopment,
        overexploitation of species, pollution, habitat loss, invasions by
        introduced species, and other issues which addressed habitat preservation
        and conservation were brought into public focus. However, maintaining the biological diversity of marine
        and estuarine systems was largely overlooked throughout the 1980s, even
        though it was generally accepted that marine systems are far more species
        rich and have greater ecosystem diversity than terrestrial systems. Representatives from 32 of the
        33 known animal phyla can be found in ocean and coastal waters. Of these, 15 phyla occur
      exclusively in estuarine or marine environments.</p>
      
      <p class="title">Defining Biodiversity:</p>
      <p class="body">The vast wealth of life on earth is unified by a
        common strand: DNA. All living things owe their forms and functions to the
        molecular makeup of their DNA. But perhaps more intriguing than life's
        unity is its immense diversity. Biological diversity - biodiversity - is
        one of the central themes of conservation. But what exactly is biological
        diversity, and why should we be concerned about preserving it? Simply put,
        biodiversity may be defined as the measure of how healthy our ecosystems
        are. Healthy ecosystems support high biological diversity; while stressed or highly disturbed ecosystems do not. When we
        consider biodiversity as a whole, we are actually addressing 3 main
        components: genetic level biodiversity, species richness and ecosystem
      diversity.</p>
      
      <p class="title">Genetic Level Biodiversity:</p>
      
      <p class="body">The term &quot;genetic diversity&quot; is the
        most fundamental level of biodiversity, and refers to the degree of
        variation in all the genes for all individuals within a species. Here we
        will define a <b>species</b> as a group consisting of all the collected populations of morphologically similar organisms which are able to
        interbreed with one another. A <b>population</b> is defined as consisting
        of all the individuals of the same species within a defined geographical area,
      for example, the Indian River Lagoon.</p>
      <p class="body">Within a species, it is theoretically possible
      for any individual to breed successfully with any other individual of the
      species. However, populations,
      tend to remain somewhat separated from each other. Thus, there is a higher
      probability that an individual within a population will select a mate from
      the same population. Within a large population, the effect of
      geographic separation of populations, which often results in reduced genetic
      mixing, is small. However, within small populations, there can be a tendency
      toward reduced genetic diversity among members of that population. Over
      long periods of time, this can lead to geographically separated
      populations diverging genetically, each population having its own set of
      genetic adaptations which allow it to live optimally within a particular habitat.</p>
      <p class="body">This genetic divergence is the basis for
      evolution. Populations having greater genetic diversity are far better
      equipped to cope with environmental change and go on to reproduce
      successfully than populations with low genetic diversity. Populations with
      low genetic diversity can become so well adapted to local conditions that any
      environmental disturbance may be enough to reduce their numbers
      dramatically, or even destroy them entirely. Thus, in thinking about
      preserving biodiversity, one must consider that each population within a
      species may have some unique set of genetic adaptations that could
      potentially assist the entire species in overcoming environmental, or
      human influenced challenges to its survival.</p>
      
      <p class="body">This term, quite simply, is the measure of the
        number of species which occur within a particular taxonomic level (i.e.,
        genus level, family level, etc.) in a
        geographic area. In marine ecosystems, species diversity tends to vary
        widely depending upon latitudinal and longitudinal location. Along a latitudinal gradient, species
        diversity tends to increase toward tropical areas. Within tropical areas, species diversity tends to increase
        along a longitudinal gradient, with more species being found toward the
        Indo-Pacific region around northeastern Australia, Indonesia and the
        Philippines. There is a moderate amount of species diversity in the
        eastern Pacific and western Atlantic oceans, with lowest species diversity
      found in the eastern Atlantic.</p>
      
      <p class="title">Ecosystem Diversity:</p>

      <p class="body">Ecosystems are the collection of all the plants and
        animals within a particular area, each differing in species composition, physical
        structure and function. Even within highly diverse ecosystems, these
        elements can differ widely. For example, most estuarine ecosystems, especially salt
        marshes, generally have high <a href="#primary production" onClick="popDef('The manufacture of organic compounds produced by plants as the result of photosynthesis', '#primary production');" Name="primary production">primary production</a>. Coral reefs, an entirely
        different type of ecosystem, must rely on the efficient recycling of
        nutrients in order to maintain high productivity. Deep sea ecosystems,
        while rich in species, have no primary production because sunlight does
      not penetrate such vast depths.</p>
      
      <p class="title">Threats to Biodiversity:</p>

      <p class="body">The factors which threaten biodiversity in
        estuaries and in the oceans are generally the same as those which affect
        biodiversity in terrestrial systems: overexploitation, physical alteration of habitat
        areas, alien species introductions, and changes in atmospheric composition. Many
        threats to the survival of life in the oceans (i.e., siltation, nutrient
        loading, pollution of air and water by toxic chemicals, etc) can originate on
        land. Also threatening marine ecosystems, particularly coastal and
        estuarine systems, is the continuous increase in the size of human
        populations, wasteful resource consumption, lack of knowledge, and poor
        management. Habitat degradation which occurs as the result of these problems,
        inevitably leads to loss of species from an ecosystem, and thus, a loss of
      biodiversity.</p>

      <p class="title">The Solution: Preserving Biodiversity:</p>
      <p class="body">In order to insure biological diversity in
        both marine and terrestrial systems, we must finally recognize the fact that our natural resource base,
        our economic development, our food, our medicine, our clothing, the air we
        breathe, indeed our very existence on this planet is dependent on the life
        around us. In preserving biological diversity, we are simply insuring our
        own continued prosperity and survival.</p>
