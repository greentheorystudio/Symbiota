Feral pigs (<i>Sus scrofa</i>) are large terrestrial mammals with rounded bodies and short legs
that show a marked degree of variation in terms of size, coat, color, tail
shape, and other physical traits (see below).  They possess well-developed
upper incisors and upper canines that often project outward and upward from the
mouth.  Their skulls are identifiable by the lack of a bony ring around the
sockets and by the tall, steep form of the cranium (Lowery 1974, Whitaker
1988).

              Belden (1993) states that in the United States, Florida's feral
              pig population is second only to Texas.  They occur in every
              county in Florida and occupy a variety of habitat types, though
              urbanized areas and areas with major agricultural operations lack
              established populations.  Trapping, hunting and agricultural
              depredation control measures have been undertaken in much of the
              state to control wild pig populations (Belden 1993).

            <p><b><font color="#008080" size="3">Reproduction:</font></b><font color="000080" size="3"><br>
             In temperate regions breeding in <i>S. scrofa</i> is confined to the spring, whereas
             in subtropical climates the breeding season is protracted.  In the
             tropics, breeding can occur throughout the year.  Regardless of
             location, peek breeding coincides with the rainy season (Nowak
             1991).
<br><br>
             Both sexes usually reach sexual maturity in the first year of
             life&#151;between 8-12 months in males and as early as 5-8 months in
             females (Johnson et al. 1982).  Despite early onset of maturity,
             female feral pigs usually do not breed prior to 18 months' age,
             while males tend not to achieve reproductive success until they
             are fully grown at approximately age five.  The estrous cycle of
             female pigs is approximately 21 days (Ingles 1965).
<br><br>
             Adult males are solitary outside of the breeding season while
             females and juveniles are gregarious (Gingerich 1994). Females
             leave the group to nest and give birth.  This nesting behavior is
             atypical of ungulate (hoofed) mammals.  Litters usually consist of
             between 3 and 12 young and females generally produce one or two
             litters each season throughout their reproductive lives (Ingles
             1965, Gingerich 1994).

            <p><font color="#008080"><b>Embryology:<br></b></font><font color="000080" size="3">
            Gestation varies between 100 and 140 days.  Young are weaned in 3-4
            months and often leave their mother before the next litter if the
            mother produces multiple litters in a breeding season (Nowack
            1991).  Early mortality rates can be high.  Baber and Coblentz
            (1986) reported that 58% of piglets died before weaning.

              Feral pigs occur from temperate climates to the tropics and their
              activity patterns are tied to the temperature regimes of the
              various climates in which they are found.  These mammals lack
              sweat glands and rely greatly on behavioral means of body
              temperature regulation (Gingerich 1994).  In hot, tropical
              climates, peak activity occurs in the early morning and late
              afternoon (Diong 1982), or during the night (Sekhar 1998).  In
              temperate regions with pronounced seasonal variation, peak
              activity times and foraging areas change to take advantage of
              biologically accommodating temperatures (Belden and Pelton 1975).
               For example, feral pigs on California's Santa Cruz Island are
              most active at mid-day during wet winter months, and at night
              during the warm, dry summer (Van Vuren 1984).

            Feral pigs will only become established in hot climates if water
              supplies are adequate to allow survival (Gingerich 1994).

            Feral pigs are omnivorous.  They use their tusks to root through
            the ground in search of roots, tubers, bulbs, worms, insects, slugs
            and snails, and other dietary items.  Additionally they will
            consume fallen acorns and other nuts, frogs, lizards and snakes,
            rodents and other vulnerable mammals, and bird eggs (Lowery 1974,
            Bratton et al. 1982, Laycock 1984, Baber and Coblentz 1987,
            Gingerich 1994).  Feral pig feeding activity can impact population
            desities of preferred prey types (Meads et al. 1984).
<br><br>
            Feral pigs are highly adaptable and opportunistic in terms of diet,
            and seasonal dietary shifts occur as food items become either
            scarce or more abundant.  For example, Wood and Roark (1980) note
            that in South Carolina feral pig populations, acorns and other nuts
            and fruits make up the bulk of the diet in the fall and winter when
            they are abundant.  In the spring, pigs shift to foliage and
            herbaceous vegetation, and to tubers and roots in the summer.  As a
            result of these dietary shifts, the degree of destructiveness
            caused by rooting can also vary by season.

            Although adult feral pigs are safe from most predators other than
            man, young animals are reportedly vulnerable to eagles and hawks,
            owls, foxes, and bobcats (Laycock 1984, Gingerich 1994).  In south
            Florida, panthers are capable of taking adult pigs as prey
            (Gingerich 1994).

           The historic native range of <i>S. scrofa</i> encompassed Europe and
           extended through continental Asia south and east into Malaysia, and
           into the islands of Sumatra and Java (Ickes et al. 2005).  <i>Sus scrofa</i> is
           now extinct across much of this historic range (Tisdell 1982).
<br><br>
Pigs were among the first mammals to be domesticated by man, beginning in China
some 7,000 years ago and possibly dating further back to 10,000 B.C. in the
region that is now Thailand (Nowack 1991).  Several millennia of selective
breeding have yielded a domesticated animal that is morphologically quite
distinct from the wild type from which they derived.
<br><br>
The first introduction to the present-day United States may have been
intentional introduction of domesticated hogs to the Hawaiian islands by
Polynesians perhaps 1,000 years ago (Nowack 1991).
<br><br>
The first introduction of domestic hogs to the continental US is historically
documented.  A vessel captained by the Spanish explorer Hernando De Soto and
carrying domestic hogs destined for the New World landed on the Gulf Coast in
1539  (Lowery 1974, Gingerich 1994).  Intentional or accidental release of
animals derived from these stocks likely represent the source of the first
feral pig populations in the continental US and in the Gulf and southeast
regions.
<br><br>
Feral pigs currently found within the United States represent a combination of
descendant lines of European wild boars originally released for sport hunting
purposes and feral animals derived from escaped domestic pigs.  These readily
interbreed where they co-occur (Whitaker 1988).  The greater the percentage of
wild boar a feral pig contains, the more it will resemble the wild type in
appearance, typically bearing a bristly coat and mane, a straight tail, and
impressive tusks (Whitaker 1988).
<br><br>
Gingerich (1994) suggests that Florida's wild hogs may represent an amalgam of
lines derived from Spanish and Russian wild boars, European hunting stock, and
escaped domestic hogs.

            The feeding activities of feral pigs may preempt dietary resources
            from co-occurring animal populations.  More importantly, the
            omnivorous nature and, particularly, the destructive rooting habits
            of feral pigs make them particularly troublesome invaders.
<br><br>
            Rooting digs up and overturns sizable patches of earth, destroys
            vegetation and seed banks, and exposes tree roots.  Soil nutrient
            leaching is accelerated (Kotanen 1994, Singer et al.
            1984, Arrington et al. 1999).
            Ground nesting birds and other species may be negatively impacted. 
            Elsewhere in the United States where feral pigs occur, species such
            as northern short-tailed shrews (<i>Blarina brevicauda</i>), southern
            red-backed voles (<i>Cleithronomys gapperi</i>), and red-cheeked salamander (<i>Plethodon jordani</i>)
            are deemed at-risk (Laylock 1984, Singer et al. 1984).  Endemic
            herbaceous vegetation such as Clingman's hedgenettle (<i>Stachys
            clingmanii</i>) and Virginia chain fern (<i>Woodwardia virginiana</i>) may
            also be impacted (Bratton et al. 1982).
<br><br>
            In Hawaii, feral pigs kill several native tree species (by felling
            or barking them) in pursuit of native tree ferns that are a
            dietary staple (Diong 1982).  On Santiago Island in Ecuador, egg
            predation by feral pigs has reduced giant tortoise and sea turtle
            population numbers (MacFarland et al. 1974, Green and Ortiz 1982, Coblentz and Baber
            1987).
<br><br>
            Where feral pigs occur in association with wetlands and coastal marshes,
            pig foraging may add to the loss of these already imperiled
            habitats.  There is at least some indication, however, that plant
            diversity in some instances may actually increase on localized
            scales in response to disturbance by pigs, e.g., if pioneering
            species move into areas that have been upturned by rooting pigs
            (Arrinton et al. 1999, Ford and Grace 1998).
<br><br>
            Baber and Coblentz (1987) indicate that feral pigs represent the
            most successful non-native large mammal in the United States.

 </font></p>
              
            <p><b><font size="3" color="#008080">Possible Economic Consequences of Invasion:<br></font></b><font size="3" color="#008080"><font color="000080">
            Landowners and farmers regularly report damage and loss due to
            feral pig activity.  Delicate food crops like corn, oats, wheat,
            and, soybeans are vulnerable, as are young trees planted in
            silviculture operations.  Home gardens often suffer damage from
            these animals.  A 1998 study by Frederick that surveyed 40
            California counties estimated economic loss resulting from pig
            rooting at $1.73 million (Frederick 1998).
<br><br>
            Natural habitats are also susceptible to damage from feral pig
            populations.  A study by Singer et al. (1984) monitoring feral pigs
            within Great Smokey Mountains National Park reports that the
            destructive foraging of these invaders exposed several thousand
            tree roots per hectare, reduced plant cover by as much as 80%, and
            increased bare ground by nearly 90%.  Forest litter and soil bulk
            density were also greatly reduced while erosion and nutrient loss
            from the forest floor to receiving river waters was doubled (see
            also Peine and Farmer 1990).  Habitat
            alteration may include loss of native vegetation and spread of
            opportunistic weeds into newly disturbed areas.
<br><br>
            Feral pigs represent a potential source of disease. They carry
            pseudorabies, (Aujeszky's disease, <i>porcine herpesvirus 1</i>), a viral
            swine disease of considerable economic importance to the hog
            industry.  Cattle are susceptible as secondary hosts, and infection
            results in the cattle disease known as mad itch.  Rats, dogs, and
            horses are also known secondary hosts, as are populations of wild
            animals such as panthers (Fenner et al. 1993, Gingerich 1994).
<br><br>
            Feral pigs are also a source of trichinosis and of swine
            brucellosis which is potentially fatal in humans (Gingerich 1994).
             Leptospirosis, foot-and-mouth disease, Japanese encephalitis and
            the parasite <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> are other disease agents harbored by
            feral pigs (Tolleson et al. 1995, Hampton
            et al. 2004, Gauss et al. 2005).

            recent (2006) outbreak of <i>E. coli</i> spinach contamination in
            California that killed at least three people and caused illness in
            at least 200.  The proposed infection pathway suggests that feral
            pigs transmitted the pathogenic <i>E. coli</i> strain to spinach fields
            from adjacent cattle pastures.  Samples from cow manure in the
            pastures tested positive for the same bacterial strain responsible
            for the disease outbreak.
<br><br>
            The World Conservation Union's Invasive Species Specialist Group
            (ISSG) lists feral pigs as among <a
            href="http://www.issg.org/database/species/search.asp?st=100ss&fr=1&str=" target="new">"100 of the world's worst invasive alien
            species"</a> and recognizes them as potentially major drivers of extinction and ecosystem change.
