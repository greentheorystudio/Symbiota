              <em>Pogonias cromis, </em>the black drum, is oblong and moderately 
              compressed with an elevated back and nearly straight ventral profile. 
              The head is short with a blunt snout and inferior, horizontal mouth. 
              The chin has 5 pores and 12-13 short barbels set close to the inner 
              edges of the lower jaw. A deep notch separates the spinous dorsal 
              fin with its 11 spines from the soft dorsal fin, which has 19 - 
              23 rays. The third dorsal spine is the longest. The anal fin has 
              2 spines and 5-7 rays. The caudal fin is truncate to emarginate. 
              Pectoral fins are approximately the same length as the head. Scales 
              are large and ctenoid. There are 41-45 lateral line scales. The 
              pharyngeal teeth are small and set in broad bands for effective 
              grinding of mollusk and arthropod shells. The vomer, palatines and 
              tongue lack teeth (Johnson 1978). </font></font></p>
            <p><font color="000090" size="3">Body color in adults is a silver 
              to black base color, highlighted with a with a coppery or brassy 
              sheen. Fins are dusky to black in color. Young typically have 4-6 
              vertical black bars along their sides. Coloration may change depending 
              on habitat or age of the fish (Simmons and Breuer 1962). In the 
              Gulf of Mexico, black drum are nearly uniformly silver in color, 
              their vertical crossbars disappearing very early in life. Fishes 
              inhabiting bays and lagoons tend to be darker in color, typically 
              with a bronze dorsal surface and gray-white sides (Simmons and Breuer 
              1962; Johnson 1978). </font></p>

              On the Atlantic coast of the United States, <em>Pogonias cromis 
              </em>occurs from southern New England south through Florida and 
              the Gulf of Mexico, to Argentina. It has been documented as far 
              north as the Bay of Fundy, but is much more common south of Chesapeake 
              Bay. Black drum are especially abundant in Florida and along the 
              Gulf coast to Texas. </font></font></p>
            <p><b><font size="3" color="#008080">IRL Distribution:</font></b><font size="3" color="#008080"><font color="000090"><br>
              Black drum are common throughout the Indian River Lagoon and have 
              notably large populations in Volusia and Martin Counties (Murphy 
              and Taylor 1995). </font></font></p>

              <em>Pogonias cromis</em> grows to a maximum size of approximately 
              170 cm (67 inches) and may weigh as much as 51.3 kg (113.1 pounds) 
              (IGFA 2001). Maximum age is estimated to be 43 years on Florida's 
              Gulf coast, and 58 years on the Atlantic Coast (Murphy and Muller 
              1995). </font></font></p>
            <p><font color="000090" size="3">Growth information for black drum 
              is relatively scarce, but some rate estimates have been produced. 
              Simmons and Breuer (1962) used length-frequency analysis and tag 
              return data to estimate growth rates in black drum, finding that 
              black drum in Texas measured approximately 160 mm (6.3 inches) standard 
              length (SL), at the end of the first year, 310 mm (12.2 inches) 
              at the end of the second year, and 415 mm (16.3 inches) by the end 
              of the third year. Older drum in their study had growth rates of 
              approximately 50 mm (1.97 inches) SL per year. </font></p>
            <p><font color="000090" size="3">There is no evidence of sex-specific 
              differences in growth rates of black drum (Beckman et al. 1990).</font></p>
            <p><b><font color="#008080" size="3">Reproduction:</font></b><font color="#008080" size="3"><font color="000090"><br>
              Black drum mature at approximately 450 - 700 mm (17.7 - 27.6 inches) 
              total length (TL) when they are 2 - 6 years of age. Males mature 
              at somewhat younger and smaller size than do females. Murphy and 
              Taylor (1989) estimated that in northeastern Florida, males reached 
              maturity at 4-5 years of age when they measured approximately 590 
              mm (23.2 inches), while females reached maturity at 5-6 years of 
              age, at measurements of 650 - 699 mm (25.6 - 27.5 inches). </font></font></p>
            <p><font color="000090" size="3"><em>Pogonias cromis</em> spawns in 
              bays, estuaries and nearshore waters (Hoese 1965; Etzold and Christmas 
              1979). Gravid and spent fishes are most commonly collected where 
              waters are 20 - 27 m (65.6 - 88.6 feet) deep (Ross et al. 1983; 
              Cody et al. 1985). </font></p>
            <p><font color="000090" size="3">Spawning periods are dependent upon 
              geographic location. In Texas, up to 90% of spawning occurs from 
              February through March (Simmons and Breuer 1962), with limited spawning 
              continuing into June and July. Cody et al. (1985)) reported that 
              in the Gulf of Mexico, spawning in deeper Gulf waters around Texas 
              occurred from November through April. Florida, black drum also spawn 
              from November through April, with activity peaking during February 
              and March (Murphy and Taylor 1989). </font></p>
            <p><font color="000090" size="3">Black drum are multiple spawners 
              with continuous oocyte recruitment throughout the spawning season 
              (Fitzhugh 1993), and are capable of spawning approximately every 
              3 days. Pearson (1929) estimated that a ripe female black drum measuring 
              1.1 m (43.3 inches) total length (TL) would produce approximately 
              6 million eggs annually. In a more recent study, Fitzhugh et al. 
              (1993) estimated fecundity of average sized females weighing 13.4 
              pounds at 32 million eggs annually. </font></p>
            <p><font color="#008080"><b>Embryology:</b><font color="000090"><br>
              Eggs of black drum are pelagic and measure 0.8 - 1 mm (0.031 - 0.039 
              inches) in diameter with 2-6 oil droplets in the early stages. Droplets 
              merge into a single drop in later stages prior to hatching. Eggs 
              hatch in less than 24 hours at 20&deg;C (Joseph et al. 1964).</font></font></p>
            <p><font color="000090">Larvae measure approximately 1.9 - 2.4 mm 
              (0.075 - 0.094 inches) TL at hatching (Joseph et al 1964). The yolk 
              sac is completely absorbed when larvae grow to 2.8 mm (0.11 inches). 
              Upon reaching approximately 15 mm (0.59 inches) TL, the overall 
              adult body shape is recognizable. </font></p>
            <p><font color="000090">After hatching, larvae rely upon tidal currents 
              for transport into estuaries, where they begin appearing in February 
              or early March.</font></p>

            <p><b><font size="3" color="#008080">Temperature:</font></b><font size="3" color="#008080"><font color="000090"><br>
              Black drum prefer waters where temperatures range from 12 - 33&deg;C 
              (McIlwain 1978). Sudden temperature drops during the winter months 
              cause them to migrate to deeper waters. Mass mortality is somewhat 
              common when sudden, sustained temperature drops occur (Simmons and 
              Breuer 1962). </font></font></p>
            <p><font color="#008080"><b>Salinity:</b><font color="000090"><br>
              <em>Pogonias cromis</em> is euryhaline and commonly found in waters 
              where salinity ranges from 9-26 ppt (McIlwain 1978). They have been 
              documented from waters of 0 - 80 ppt (Gunter 1956; Simmons and Breuer 
              1962; Leard et al 1993)), though adults found at extremely high 
              salinities show signs of stress and physical damage (Murphy and 
              Taylor 1995). Peters and McMichael (1990) reported juvenile black 
              drum, while occurring over widely varying temperatures and salinities, 
              most often are collected in low to moderate salinity waters over 
              unvegetated mud bottoms. Larger juveniles occur most often in higher 
              salinity waters. </font></font></p>

              Black drum are primarily bottom feeders, though they have been occasionally 
              observed feeding near the surface on small finfishes such as menhaden 
              (Ackerman 1951). Pearson (1929) reported black drum bottom feeding 
              in a vertical position in waters so shallow, their tails protruded 
              from the water.</font></font></p>
            <p><font color="000090" size="3">Larvae feed primarily on zooplankton 
              (Benson 1982). Juveniles feed on annelids, soft crustaceans, amphipods, 
              and small fishes (Simmons and Breuer 1962; Peters and McMichael 
              1990). In Texas, approximately 33% of the diet in black drum measuring 
              21 - 50 cm (8.3 - 19.7 inches) or more in length consisted of the 
              surfclam (<em>Mulinia</em> sp.). Larger drum consume mostly mollusks 
              and crabs, while the largest specimens consumed mollusks and shrimp 
              (Simmons and Breuer 1962). Miles (1949) reported that black drum 
              in Texas fed primarily on shrimp, mollusks, and vegetation.</font></p>
            <p><font color="000090" size="3">Large, captive drum were capable 
              of feeding on more than 2 commercial-sized oysters per kilogram 
              of body weight daily (Cave and Cake 1980). Black drum are known 
              to damage commercial stocks of oysters on seed reefs in lease areas 
              in Gulf of Mexico waters (Benson 1982). </font></p>
            <p><b><font color="#008080" size="3">Competitors:</font></b><font color="#008080" size="3"><font color="000090"><br>
              Black drum likely compete with other drums, especially the red drum 
              for benthic food resources, but because of their strong pharyngeal

              Juvenile black drum are preyed upon by a variety of larger fishes 
              such as seatrout and jacks. Larger black drum are likely to be preyed 
              upon by sharks (Murphy and Muller 1995)</font></p>
            <p><font color="#008080"><b>Habitats:</b><font color="000090"><br>
              Larvae enter estuaries on tidal currents and utilize seagrasses 
              as nursery habitat. Postlarvae prefer nutrient-rich and somewhat 
              muddy waters of tidal creeks and channels. Juveniles are found more 
              often over muddy bottoms in estuaries. Adults are usually common 
              over sand or sand/mud bottom types in shallow coastal and estuarine 
              waters, especially in high runoff areas, oyster reefs and shell 
              hash (Pearson 1929). </font></font></p>
            <p><font color="#008080"><font color="000090">Adults sometimes move 
              onto near-shelf waters, but are primarily estuarine-dwelling and 
              show little migratory behavior. Simmons and Breuer (1962) reported 
              that tagged black drum in Texas generally moved less than 5 miles 
              from where they were tagged. Beaumarriage (1969) reported similar 
              results in Florida black drum. </font></font></p>
            <p><font color="000090">Osburn and Matlock (1984) examined movements 
              of black drum in Texas, reporting that black drum less than 3 years 
              of age showed limited movement from bay systems into the Gulf of 
              Mexico. Older fishes were more commonly taken in deeper waters of 
              the Gulf, leading the authors to hypothesize that permanent movement 
              of black drum to deeper gulf waters occurs in fishes older than 
              4 years of age; with bays and estuaries thus supplying young fishes 
              to spawning stocks of older fishes.</font></p>

              commercial species in Florida, but are considered important recreationally. 
              Between 1987 - 2001, the total commercial harvest of <em>Pogonias 
              cromis </em> in Florida totaled 1.6 million pounds, and was valued 
              at $679,928. Approximately 69.7% of black drum landings occurred 
              on Florida's west coast. East coast landings totaled approximately 
              484,600 pounds,and were valued at $290,466. Of this, the 5 county 
              area encompassing the IRL (Volusia, Brevard, Indian River, St. Lucie 
              and Martin Counties) accounted for 94% of east coast landings (272,514 
              pounds), and was valued at $131,995. This ranks the black drum sixty-ninth 
              in commercial value and fifty-ninth in pounds harvested. </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="000090">Figure 1 below shows the 
              dollar value of the black drum commercial fishery to IRL counties 
              by year. The fishery ranged in value from a high of $27,414 in 1988, 
              to a low of $2,924 the following year. Volusia County accounted 
              for 49.2% of the catch, followed distantly by Brevard (21.2%), Martin 
              (14.3%), St. Lucie (12.0%) and Indian River (3.3%) Counties. </font><font color="000090">Of 
              note is the decrease in commercial catch, especially in Volusia 
              and Martin Counties after the 1995 ban on gill-netting was implemented.

              The black drum, especially at larger size, is not generally considered 
              a high-quality food fish due to commonly being infested with cestodes 
              (spaghetti worms) (Simmons and Breuer 1962; Etzolt and Christmas 
              1979). However, black drum measuring less than 20 inches are valued 
              in the recreational fishery (Silverman 1979). </font></span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><font color="000090">Recreational 
              landings of black drum are significantly larger than commercial 
              landings in all states within their range. For example, in 2003, 
              757,867 pounds of black drum were landed in Florida by commercial 
              and recreational interests. Of the total harvest, 98% of landings 
              were made by recreational anglers rather than by commercial fishers, 
              with 72% of landings occurring on the Atlantic coast. </font></span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="000090">Within the 5-county area 
              of the Indian River Lagoon, black drum are regularly taken, but 
              are not especially prized. Based on angler survey data, recreational 
              anglers captured 926,545 black drum between 1997 - 2004 (Table 4, 
              Figure 3), not including those fishes that were caught and released. 
              The bulk of the recreational catch (43.6%) was taken within inland 
              waters other than the Indian River Lagoon. Approximately 36.2% of 
              the recreational catch is harvested from nearshore waters up to 
              3 miles offshore. Anglers fishing in the Indian River Lagoon took 
              approximately 19.6% of the harvest, while those fishing up to 200 
              miles offshore accounted for only 0.6% of the total.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="000090"> As of 2005, Fishing regulations 
              in Florida state that black drum must be no less than 14 inches 
              TL, but not more than 24 inches TL to be of legal size; however, 
              one black drum larger than 24 inches TL may be kept. A bag limit 
              of 5 legal-sized black drum per person per day is in effect.</font></p>
