    <p class="body">Filter-feeding oyster are important members of the Indian River Lagoon
          because they reduce turbidity and improve water quality by removing
          suspended organics, phytoplankton, and detritus (Peterson et al. 2003).
          Since the 1940s, over 250 acres of oyster habitat has been lost in the
          Indian River Lagoon (Wilson et al. 2005).  This is evident in aerial photos
          dating as far back as 1943 (Grizzle et al. 2002).   The extent to which
          natural as well as anthropogenic effects including human-induced salinity
          fluctuations, muck removal projects, and biotoxin accumulation has impacted
          the Indian River Lagoon oyster reefs is not well understood.   Reports such
          as the Independent Scientific Review of the Indian River Lagoon - South
          Project Implementation Report (Bartell et al.) commissioned by the U. S.
          Army Corps of Engineers Jacksonville District, the Indian River Lagoon
          Biotoxin and Aquatic Animal Health History and Background Report (Provancha
          and Van den Ende 2006), and the Indian River Lagoon Comprehensive
          Conservation and Management Plan Update 2008 suggest that heavy boating,
          poor management of sewage discharge, agricultural runoff, freshwater
          flooding from flood control canals, muck removal, and biotoxins are having
          negative impacts on the plants and animals that live in the Indian River
          Lagoon.</p>
         <p class="title">Boating Impacts</p>
          <p class="body">The most pronounced and documented changes to the oyster reefs are the dead
            margins appearing in areas of high boat use (Grizzle et al. 2002).  The
            dead margins consist primarily of piles of dead oyster shells that occur
            when boat propellers drag along the bottom in shallow areas displacing
            living and dead oyster shells.  Considerable damage is also caused by boat
            wakes which eroding both shorelines and oyster reefs and stir up bottom
            sediments causing the water to cloud (Grizzle et al. 2002).   Wave action
            caused by boats results in sediment build-up on the oyster beds as the
            disturbed sediment moves out of the water column interfering with filter
            feeding and larval settlement.   Although dead margins are sometimes
            considered beneficial because they may create a buffer back reef against
            wave-motion, current research suggests that oyster reefs with dead margins
            have reduced habitat complexity as well as reduced diversity of species
            (Stiner and Walters 2008).</p>

           <p class="title">Salinity Fluctuations</p>
           <p class="body">Salinity fluctuations in the Indian River Lagoon are a major concern.  They
        can be caused by the input of freshwater from sewage discharge,
        agricultural runoff, and freshwater from flood control canals.  Algal
        blooms occur when environmental conditions are optimal for growth.
        Discharge of nutrients from agricultural, ranch and urban areas cause an
        increase in nutrients in the sediments of the lakes of Upper St. John River
        Basin (Bremmer et al. 1999).   Freshwater runoff that causes nutrient
        enrichment in the estuarine waters can lead to blooms of some species but
        the data is not clear that this is true for all species (Burkholder 1998).
        Blooms of some species occur during El Nino events when the water
        temperatures are increased (Burkholder 1998).   Periods of reduced
        salinities that lead to oyster death see subsequent algal blooms.    Point
        and non-point runoff in the Indian River Lagoon do have impacts but it is
        unclear how much impact relative to the dominant flood-control influences
        (WS Arnold, personal communication).</p>
        <p class="body">A decrease in salinity to < 10&permil; appears to shorten the reproductive and
            settlement season of the oyster <i>Crassostrea virginica</i> (Bartell et al.), a
            major reef builder in the estuaries of the Indian River Lagoon.   The C-44
            canal is a major drainage canal that connects Lake Okeechobee with the
            South Fork of the St. Lucie estuary. The fresh water flows from this flood
            canal appear to result in low salinities for several weeks at a time every
            year potentially interfering with the reproductive season of <i>C. virginica</i>
            (Bartell et al., Wilson et al. 2005).   Recent unpublished data show that
            fresh water from flood control canals in the St. Lucie and Sebastian
            estuaries combined with effects of the hurricanes of 2004 and 2005 almost
            completely eliminated live oysters from these areas.  While live oysters
            did return within about one year, the chronic and long-term release of
            fresh water particularly into the St. Lucie system appears to have reduced
            the areal coverage of oysters in that estuary (W. S. Arnold, personal
            communication). Drainage of fresh water into the St. Lucie Estuary and its
            tributaries has also recently been shown to cause a shift in species
            composition (Wilson et al. 2005).  Human management that results in
            salinities outside of the suitable ranges for survival and reproductive
            success of reef building oysters will negatively impact the reefs (W. S.
            Arnold, personal communication).  In addition to the low salinity effects,
            large, poorly timed, and poorly located freshwater discharges into the
            Indian River Lagoon has resulted in the accumulation of large amounts of
            muck on the floor of the lagoon, clouding of the water column, and the
            destruction of oyster and sea grass beds (Bartell et al.)</p>

            <p class="title">Dredging and Muck Removal</p>

            <p class="body">Dredging and sand replenishment is a process used to replenish sand on
            eroded beaches in the estuaries.  Near shore hard bottom habitats can be
            buried during this process or waters can become silty blocking light and
            interfering with the filter feeding of oysters.  In areas where dredging or
            burial of oyster reefs occur, there is a significant of juvenile fish.
            This disturbs ecologically and commercially important species.  Although
            long term effects have not been measured, it is likely that these events
            will result in permanent displacement of fish populations.  Natural
            recovery from wave action is unlikely in areas where oyster reefs are
            buried (Lindeman and Snyder 1998). <br><br>
            Muck removal, primarily by dredging, is occurring in areas where the
            accumulation of sediment in the Indian River Lagoon has resulted in the
            destruction of seagrass beds and oyster reef habitats.   The purpose of
            these projects is to create new space for oyster recruitment by removing
            dead habitat.  However, while appearing beneficial, several problems have
            arose including clouding of the water, algal blooms that quickly take over,
            and the re-accumulation of sediment from other anthropogenic sources.  A
            potential solution for these new problems is to set sediment traps in
      affected areas (Bartell et al.).</p>

  <p class="title">Biotoxins</p>

    <p class="body">Biotoxins are an important health threat to humans consuming shellfish
    from the Indian River Lagoon.   In addition, there are several reported
    cases of marine mammals and fish becoming ill and/or dying after coming
    in contact with their microscopic source of biotoxins (Burkholder 1998,
    Steidinger et al. 1998).   The impact of biotoxins from harmful algal
    blooms on the health of oysters and other invertebrate species is less
    well documented.  Harmful algal blooms usually refer to expansive
    growths of cytotoxic bluegreen algae and phytoplankton.  The Indian
    River Lagoon is reported to host 21 potentially toxic microalgal
    species (Provancha and Van den End 2006).</p>
    <p class="body">The most commonly
    encountered neurotoxins are saxitoxin, tetrodotoxin, and domoic acid.
    In the Indian River Lagoon, saxitoxin is produced by <i>Pyrodinium</i> var.
    <i>bahamense</i>, Alexandrium, and <i>Gymnodinium</i> and causes paralytic shellfish
    poisoning.  In 1996, a bloom of <i>G. pulchellum</i> was reported to cause
    fish (species: <i>Centropomus undecimalis</i>, <i>Mugil cephalus</i>, <i>Arius felis</i>,
    <i>Sciaenops ocellatus</i>, <i>Archosargus probatocephalus</i>, and <i>Pogonias cromis</i>)
    and invertebrate kills (species: <i>Callinectes sapidus</i>, and <i>Panaeus</i> spp.)
    in the Indian River Lagoon (Steidinger et al. 1998).   Tetrodotoxin is
    found in puffer fish and causes puffer fish poisoning.  There is
    evidence suggesting that tetrodotoxin is produced by one or more marine
    bacteria. Domoic acid is produced by Psedo-nitzschia and causes amnesic
    shellfish poisoning.  The dinoflagellates or diatoms that produce many
    of the biotoxins are always present and are not usually toxic except in
    times when large blooms of these micro-algae occur.  During a bloom
    filter feeding invertebrates such as clams, mussels, and oysters ingest
    the microalgae and accumulate the biotoxins in their tissues which are
    then passed on to higher level consumers (e.g. carnivorous gastropods
    and crustaceans) that will also accumulate the biotoxins in their flesh
    (Burkholder 1998, Provancha and Van den End 2006).  Some bivalves
    exhibit symptoms of narcosis and altered feeding behavior in the
    presence of <i>Gymnodium</i> and <i>Alexandrium</i> spp.  (Burkholder 1998).</p>
