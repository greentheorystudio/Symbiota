                <p class="body">Impounding
                    of salt marshes and mangrove forests is likely the most broadly
                    reaching and destructive disturbance in these coastal Florida ecosystems
                    (Montague &amp; Wiegert 1990). <br/>
                    Before mosquito control methods like
                    impoundments were in place, mosquito landings were among the highest
                    densities ever recorded in the continental United States (Provost
                    1949), reaching 500 per person per minute in some areas of Florida
                    (Leenhouts 1983).</p>
                <p class="body">Ditching in marshes in the 1930s was ineffective,
                    and the use of DDT pesticide in the 1940s had adverse effects on
                    wildlife (Montague &amp; Wiegert 1990). In the 1950s, impounding
                    marshes became an effective and seemingly less invasive way to control
                    mosquitoes. Using this method, salt marshes and intertidal mangroves
                    are closed off to tidal influences and the water is pumped out,
                    allowing mosquitoes to lay eggs on exposed sediment. The impoundments
                    are then flooded to kill eggs and larvae. Today, 192 impoundments
                    are active on the east coast of Florida alone (Rey &amp; Kain 1989).
                    Many of these areas are still closed systems that allow influx of
                    freshwater from precipitation and runoff, creating wide variations
                    in salinity. This, along with the flooding process, can cause dieback
                    of natural vegetation and establishment of more oligohaline species.
                    Breeding and spawning behaviors of fishes and invertebrates can
                    also be restricted in closed systems.</p>
                <p class="body">One of the most devastating
                    effects of impounding was to the dusky seaside sparrow, <em>Ammodramas
                        maritimus nigrescens</em>, which was driven to extinction in 1987
                    (Kale 1996). Currently, several areas have begun operating on a
                    rotational impoundment management (RIM) approach (David 1992). The
                    RIM plan allows impoundments to be open to regular tidal flows and
                    wildlife migrations during non-breeding months. <br/>
                    From May to August,
                    impoundments are closed to control mosquito reproduction. The addition
                    of culverts to enhance tidal cycles in open impoundments (known
                    as breached-RIM or restored areas) have helped to increase biodiversity,
                    correct chemical values for sediments and to re-establish common
                    vegetation (Brockmeyer <em>et al.</em> 1997, Klassen 1998, Poulakis <em>et al.</em> 2002, Rey &amp;
                    Cain 1993).</p>
                <p class="body">Mangrove species seem
                    to respond differently to RIM and restored areas. For example, the
                    red mangrove, <a href="../taxa/index.php?taxon=Rhizophora mangle"><em>Rhizophora mangle</em></a>,
                    reaches higher densities in RIM and restored impoundments; whereas,
                    the black mangrove, <a href="../taxa/index.php?taxon=Avicennia germinans"><em>Avicennia
                            germinans</em></a>,
                    grows best in natural undeveloped areas (Middleton <em>et al.</em> 2008). More information on
                    mosquito impoundments can be found by
                    navigating to the impoundment link on the main habitat page.</p>

                    use changes from the growing population and urbanization in Florida
                    and throughout the world have altered coastal ecosystems. <br/>
                    In Florida,
                    mangroves have been removed and both these areas and salt marshes
                    have been filled with dredged material to create roads, residential
                    communities and businesses. <br/>
                    Habitat fragmentation has occurred from
                    this development, fracturing animal communities and leaving ecosystems
                    more vulnerable to other habitat disturbances (Larson 1995). Fortunately,
                    substantial mangroves and salt marshes lay within protected areas
                    such as the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge and property
                    managed by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. Proper
                    management provides conservation from further development and encourages
                    restoration programs that work to increase habitat acreage.</p>
                <a name="muck"></a>
                <p class="title">Muck &amp; Nutrients</p>
                <p class="body">Accumulations
                    of fine-grained, organic-rich clays and silt known as muck are introduced
                    to coastal environments from terrestrial and industrial runoff.
                    Muck generally settles into depressions in the sediment, and can
                    reach up to 2 m deep in some areas of the IRL (Trefry <em>et al.</em> 1990). Disturbance from boat
                    traffic, wind and waves can suspend
                    muck, creating particulates that cloud the water, reducing sunlight
                    penetration and retarding plant and algal growth (Trefry <em>et
                        al.</em> 2007). <br/>
                    Transported in the water column by currents, muck
                    can settle in salt marshes and mangrove forests, possibly smothering
                    young vegetation. Muck accrual in the IRL has been ongoing for the
                    past 40 to 60 years. Although less than 10% of the IRL bottom was
                    covered in muck in 1990, coverage continues to grow (Trefry <em>et
                        al.</em> 1990, Trefry <em>et al.</em> 2007).</p>
                <p class="body">In addition to the
                    physical stresses caused by this sediment accumulation, muck carries
                    large quantities of nutrients and toxic substances that can create
                    health problems or death for a variety of aquatic organisms. Excess
                    nitrogen and phosphorous can alter the dominant plants in marshes
                    and mangroves, allowing some species to thrive outside of their
                    natural elevation (Levine <em>et al.</em> 1998). Recently, dredging
                    projects in isolated areas of the lagoon, including the St. Sebastian
                    River, Turkey Creek and Crane Creek, have successfully removed thousands
                    of cubic meters of muck, along with harmful chemicals like pesticides
                    that are incorporated into the sediment (Trefry &amp; Trocine 2002).
                    <br/>
                    Coupled with decreases in terrestrial and industrial runoff, further
                    dredging projects could result in long-term reductions of muck throughout
                    the IRL.</p>

                <p class="title">Invasive Species</p>
                <p class="body">Bioinvasions
                    have become high profile issues affecting ecosystem dynamics in
                    both aquatic and terrestrial environments. Because salt marshes
                    and mangroves are unique mixtures of both habitats, invasive species
                    from land and sea pose threats to biodiversity and ecosystem health.
                    In Florida, the introduced nutria, <em>Myocastor coypus</em>, contributes
                    to the loss of marsh acreage by foraging on vegetation (Ford &amp;
                    Grace 1998). Changes in water flow around salt marshes and mangroves
                    have allowed for expansion of the invading Brazilian pepper, <a
                            href="../taxa/index.php?taxon=Schinus terebinthifolius"><em>Schinus
                            terebinthifolius</em></a>, and the Australian pine, <a
                            href="../taxa/index.php?taxon=Casuarina equistifolia"><em>Casuarina
                            equistifolia</em></a>. Closing portions of these habitats for mosquito
                    impoundments has reduced the salinity, allowing the invasion of
                    more oligohaline vegetation and animals (FWS 1999) such as the blackchin
                    tilapia, <em><a href="../taxa/index.php?taxon=Sarotherodon melanotheron">Sarotherodon
                            melanotheron</a></em> (Faunce <em>et al.</em> 1999, Poulakis <em>et
                        al.</em> 2002). Furthermore, disturbed or barren areas will often
                    be colonized by invasives before native plants can become established.
                    Efforts are ongoing to remove invasive plants from terrestrial areas,
                    but aquatic invasions of fishes and invertebrates are often difficult
                    or impossible to reverse, and can only be managed to prevent further
                    range expansion.</p>

                <a name="weather"></a>
                <p class="title">Hurricanes</p>
                <p class="body">Salt marshes, mangroves and other coastal ecosystems
                    can usually recover quickly from natural disturbances such as fire
                    and hurricanes. However, when disturbance events occur in close
                    succession, they may have lasting effects on the ecosystems. Hurricanes
                    produce storm surges, wind and waves that can impact mangroves and
                    marshes in several ways. Upper marshes and mangrove swamps can experience
                    an influx of seawater at a salinity to which vegetation is not accustomed,
                    causing dieback of several plant species. Wind can strip trees and
                    bushes of foliage and damage the trunk. The white mangrove, <a
                            href="../taxa/index.php?taxon=Laguncularia racemosa"><em>Laguncularia
                            racemosa</em></a>, is the mangrove species most susceptible to wind
                    damage (Doyle <em>et al.</em> 1995). <br/>
                    In addition, lower elevations
                    can experience extreme rates of sedimentation or erosion. Sediment
                    erosion can wash away much of the vegetation, reducing habitat acreage.
                    However, sediment accretion could be more harmful, essentially covering
                    marsh and mangrove areas (Rejmanek<em> et al.</em> 1998) and smothering
                    sessile benthic invertebrates. One example of rapid sedimentation
                    occurred in the upper Chesapeake Bay, when over a 70-year period
                    50% of the sediment accumulation was attributed to one flood event
                    and a single hurricane (Schubel &amp; Hirschberg 1978). Regeneration
                    of mangrove forests following substantial storm damage may take
                    decades, and restored swamps may have altered biodiversity and plant
                    zonation (Ellison &amp; Farnsworth 1990).</p>

                <a name="sealevel"></a>
                <p class="title">Sea Level Rise</p>
                <p class="body">Much
                    attention has been given to the effects of rising sea level on coastal
                    ecosystems throughout the world. As intertidal communities, salt
                    marshes and mangroves are at risk from both the amplitude and rate
                    of this rise. For the ecosystems to thrive, they must occur at the
                    appropriate elevation and slope. In fact, one of the most common
                    reasons for restoration failure in salt marshes is choosing an improper
                    site based on these parameters (Crewz &amp; Lewis 1991). As sea
                    level rises, it is possible for marshes and mangroves to shift in
                    a landward direction if the rate of rise is slow enough for sediment
                    accretion to occur (Montague &amp; Wiegert 1990). However, coastal
                    development and steep terrain may inhibit plant migration, changing
                    zonation in these habitats or flooding them completely. In addition,
                    compression of the intertidal zone can lead to increased interspecific
                    competition and loss of biodiversity. See <a href="Climate_Change.php">Climate Change and the
