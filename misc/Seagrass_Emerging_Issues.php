                <p class="body">Seagrasses have occupied shallow marine environments for approximately the
                    past 100 million years (Duarte 2001). In that time, the 60 or so worldwide
                    seagrass species have persisted in the face of continual environmental
                    change, including global climate shifts and changing sea levels. Much more
                    recently-perhaps the last 100 years or so-seagrass ecosystems throughout
                    much of the world have been subjected to new survival challenges posed by
                    manmade alterations to the environment. Many of these changes are
                    occurring very rapidly, and complex biological systems such as seagrass
                    habitats are not equipped to adapt to rapid environmental change. </p>

                <p class="body">Light availability is essential for seagrass beds to thrive and grow. The
                    seagrass species that inhabit the IRL all have relatively high light
                    requirements and the distribution of seagrass habitats in the lagoon is
                    restricted to those shallow areas where water clarity is sufficient to
                    allow adequate light penetration. Water quality conditions that impede the
                    penetration of sunlight to the benthic environment threaten seagrass
                    health.</p>

                <p class="body">A number of human activities within the IRL watershed have impacted the
                    seagrass habitats of the lagoon. The most significant of these are
                    salinity fluctuation due to altered hydrology and stormwater runoff,
                    dredging and increased sediment loading, and increased nutrient and
                    chemical pollutant loading to the lagoon. Biotoxin accumulation is another
                    emerging issue impacting the health of seagrass community components. Each
                    of these issues, their effect on IRL seagrass communities, and current
                    efforts directed at finding solutions are discussed below.
                </p>

                <a name="hydrology"></a>
                <p class="title">Hydrologic Alterations and Excess Freshwater</p>
                <p class="body">For most of the IRL seagrasses, a salinity of 20 ppt appears to be optimal
                    for growth (wigeongrass, <i>Ruppia maritima</i>, is the exception, growing best
                    under less saline conditions). The spring-summer seagrass growing season
                    coincides with Florida's wet season, however, and local salinities often
                    drop below this optimum during this period. Seagrasses can survive
                    exposure to lower salinities but growth is impacted. If low-salinity
                    conditions persist for an extended period, however, seagrass bed health
                    will suffer and dieback is likely (Hanisak 2002).</p>

                <p class="body">A defining feature of the IRL is that it is an estuary, occupying the
                    narrow boundary between land and sea and connected to the Atlantic
                    Ocean by five narrow inlets. The salinity regimes within specific
                    segments of the 250 km-long system are largely determined by proximity
                    both to ocean inlets and to various surface freshwater inputs like
                    streams, rivers, canals, and ditches. Limited water exchange with the
                    ocean through inlets spaced unevenly down the length of the system
                    gives rise to an estuary that is very sensitive to the volume and
                    timing of freshwater discharged to it from the surrounding watershed
                    (the area of land from which water drains to a receiving water body).

                <p class="body">The historic IRL watershed was around 231,480 ha (572,00 acres). Since
                    around 1916, however, the creation of drainage canals to increase
                    agriculture production and for flood control has artificially enlarged the
                    IRL watershed to the west, to include land that did not naturally drain
                    into the lagoon. Fresh water that historically drained into the St. Johns
                    River or Lake Okeechobee, for example, now flows to the lagoon instead.
                    The area of the IRL watershed has been artificially increased to more than
                    566,000 ha (1.4 million acres). This means that the lagoon now receives
                    freshwater discharge from two-and-a-half times more land than it did a
                    century or so ago. The long-term result has been a dramatic decline in
                    lagoon water quality, and in seagrass health. Declines in IRL seagrass
                    coverage have been documented since the 1950s, with 100% loss recorded in
                    some areas (Haddad 1985). The declines correlate with increased turbidity
                    and general water quality decline (Morris and Tomasko, 1993). For a more
                    detailed look at seagrass coverages trends over time in the lagoon, <a
                            href="IRL_Seagrasstrends.php">click
                        here</a>.</p>

                <p class="body">The health of animals comprising the seagrass ecosystem is also
                    affected by fluctuating salinity. For example, the planktonic eggs of
                    spotted seatrout and other fish fail to maintain buoyancy under
                    low-salinity conditions. The distribution of these eggs within the
                    water column, as well as their health and survival, is therefore likely
                    to be influenced by localized salinity conditions (SJRWM 2007). In
                    addition, oysters, clams and other animals, including the larval forms
                    of many lagoon organisms, are sensitive to fluctuations in salinity as
                    well. Hard clams (<i>Mercenaria mercenaria</i>) can briefly tolerate
                    salinities as low as 15 ppt, and eastern oysters (<i>Crassostrea
                        virginica</i>) survive at salinities as low as 2 ppt. However,
                    seasonal low salinity conditions-particularly those caused by wet
                    season stormwater discharges to the lagoon through the drainage canal
                    network-can temporarily reduce local salinities such that the health
                    and survivorship of these and other organisms are compromised.<br/>

                    A three-week long controlled freshwater discharge of approximately 70
                    cubic meters (2,500 cubic feet) per second from Lake Okeechobee through
                    canal C-44 into the St. Lucie Estuary in the southern end of the IRL
                    system in the early 1980s resulted in a localized drop in salinity to a
                    minimum of 0.5 ppt. This discharge event resulted in significant
                    change in the benthic and fish communities, including loss of species
                    both through mortality and avoidance and the establishment of some
                    freshwater species (Haunert and Startzman 1985, Strom and Thompson
                    2000).</p>

                <p class="title">Stormwater Runoff</p>
                <p class="body">Nonpoint source (i.e., no single identifiable source) pollution,
                    generated over a wide area, contributes significantly to the pollutant
                    load discharged into the IRL. Stormwater discharges are one type of
                    nonpoint source pollution. The IRL watershed typically receives around
                    127 cm (50 inches) of rain a year, with most of that coming in the
                    spring-summer wet season. While much of this stormwater runoff is
                    destined to flow to the estuary by definition, how it gets there is now
                    very different than it was historically.<br/>
                    Prior to the human development or the IRL watershed area occurrong during the last
                    century, most rainfall within the IRL watershed fell onto upland
                    habitats where it would percolate through permeable soils and then
                    slowly travel to the lagoon. On the way, much of the precipitation
                    would be taken up by vegetation and the remainder would be naturally
                    scrubbed of contaminants as it made its way to the estuary. By the
                    time it entered the lagoon, this water would have been relatively
                    clean.<br/>
                    Now, however, impermeable surfaces like roads, parking
                    lots, and rooftops cover much of the area where this natural
                    cleaning process once occurred. Large volumes of stormwater runoff
                    today rapidly flow into creeks, streams, canals, and ditches, and
                    then to the lagoon. Sediments, decomposed organic matter,
                    nutrients, heavy metals, viruses and bacteria, and other pollutants
                    are swept up in the runoff and carried to the lagoon.</p>

                <p class="title">Nutrient Input</p>
                <p class="body">All of the excess fresh water entering the lagoon carries with it a
                    nutrient and pollutant load that further impacts the health of the IIRL
                    ecosystems. Excess nutrients promote the growth of water column
                    phytoplankton and seagrass epiphytes which preempt light before it reaches
                    the seagrass. Dense phytoplankton blooms also reduce light penetration by
                    elevating water column color and turbidity (Kenworthy and Haunert 1991,
                    Morris and Tomasko 1993).</p>

                <p class="body">Increasing nutrient concentrations also correlate with decreasing dissolved
                    oxygen (Dodds and Welch, 2000). Biotic breakdown of the increased biomass
                    generated by algal primary producers increases oxygen demand. The primary
                    producers themselves also reduce oxygen levels during nighttime respiration
                    in the absence of photosynthesis.</p>

                <p class="body">Examination of a single large canal-the C-25 Canal in the south IRL
                    region-hints at the magnitude of the nutrient loads entering the IRL. This
                    canal system drains an area of approximately 15,380 ha (38,000 acres) in
                    Indian River and St. Lucie Counties and discharges into the lagoon through
                    a control structure on Taylor Creek. The canal releases an average of
                    nearly 212 million cubic meters (56.5 billion gallons) per year of
                    freshwater. This volume of water carries with it more than 280 tons of
                    nitrogen and nearly 40 tons of phosphorus (FDEP 2003).</p>

                <p class="body">Residential septic systems are another source of nutrient loading to the
                    lagoon. Although each septic system discharges only a small amount of
                    nutrients to the environment, the cumulative impact of all such discharges
                    is substantial. Septic system discharge may also contribute to elevated
                    levels of bacterial contamination.</p>

                <p class="title">Turbidity, Sediments and Muck</p>
                <p class="body">Sediments entering the lagoon can affect water column turbidity and light
                    penetration, potentially diminishing seagrass productivity. Most sediments
                    that naturally occur in the lagoon are relatively large in the silt, sand,
                    and shell fragment size classes. The are generally too heavy to become
                    resuspended in the water column and therefore have little effect on water
                    clarity. However, about 10% of the lagoon bottom is covered with a loose,
                    fine-grain, organic-rich black mud commonly referred to as 'muck.'
                    Typically found in deeper areas such as dredged channels and the
                    Intracoastal Waterway (ICW), these deposits settle onto bottom habitats,
                    potentially smothering organisms or blocking light penetration. Muck is
                    also found at or near the mouths of most of the major freshwater
                    tributaries of the lagoon, with the tributary mouths acting as traps
                    capturing these sediments before they enter the lagoon proper.</p>

                <p class="body">Muck harms fish, shellfish, and the seagrasses they inhabit. It is easily
                    stirred up and resuspended by boats as well as storms, leading to elevated
                    turbidity and decreased light penetration. Muck deposits frequently also
                    havehigh levels of heavy metals such as copper, lead, and zinc. Heavy
                    metals can be toxic to marine life, with effects ranging from illness to
                    reproductive failure and mortality.</p>

                <p class="title">Biotoxins</p>
                <p class="body">News headlines are increasingly occupied by stories relating outbreaks of
                    human illness to the consumption of tainted seafood. The bioaccumulation
                    of environmental toxins in the tissues of lagoon fish and shellfish is
                    certainly cause for concern from a human health standpoint. From the
                    standpoint of the environmental health of the IRL, biotoxins are also of
                    great concern.</p>

                <p class="body">Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are the most common source of deleterious
                    environmental biotoxins in Florida's marine environments. Harmful
                    blooms of the dinoflagellate <i>Karenia brevis</i>, and to a lesser
                    extent other dinoflagellates, are responsible for Florida's red tides.
                    The brevitoxins produced by red tide are capable of killing fish,
                    birds, and other marine animals, and can also cause severe human health
                    problems (FWRI undated). Ciguatera toxin is another well-known marine
                    toxin, although it is less prevalent in Florida than other biotoxins.
                    Ciguatera toxin is produced by cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) and
                    increasingly accumulates in the tissues of successive consumers up the
                    food chain. Ciguatera toxin causes severe gastrointestinal and
                    neurological illness when ingested by humans.</p>

                <p class="title">Other Biotoxins</p>
                <p class="body">Tetrodotoxin is the toxin responsible for the puffer
                    fish toxicity that sometimes strikes consumers of Japanese fugu. But
                    in 2002, a different toxin called saxitoxin was revealed to be the
                    culprit in 19 cases of human poisoning involving puffer fish from the
                    IRL (SJRWMD 2007). Unlike tetradoxin, saxitoxin is not concentrated
                    within certain organs of the fish, and it can't be removed from the
                    fish or detoxified by cooking or freezing (Brevard County Health
                    Department undated). Saxitoxin was also implicated as the toxin
                    produced in a 1996 IRL bloom of the dinoflagellate <i>Gymnodinium
                        pulchellum</i> that resulted in a series of fish and invertebrate
                    kills. Catfish, mullet, snook, redfish, blue crabs, and penaeid shrimp
                    were among the animals affected (Steidinger et al. 1998).</p>

                <p class="title">Disease-Causing Organisms</p>
                <p class="body">Also affecting the health of animals in the
                    lagoon is a number of infectious diseases that are not yet entirely
                    understood. Among them are a viral fibropapilloma that causes
                    unsightly and life-threatening tumors on green (and, to a lesser
                    extent, loggerhead) sea turtles inhabiting the IRL (Hirama and Ehrhart.
                    2007). A fungal pathogen called lobomycosis infects a significant
                    percentage of the IRL bottlenose dolphin population (Reif et al.
                    2006). Lobomycosis is a chronic cutaneous and subcutaneous
                    infection resulting in ulcerative skin lesions that can cover much
                    of the infected animal's body. The condition is contractible by
                    humans, adding to the urgency of better understanding the IRL
                    dolphin infections.</p>

                <p class="title">Working Towards Solutions</p>
                <p class="body">Critical as water clarity is to seagrass health, restoring water clarity is
                    a central goal of initiatives designed to improve IRL seagrass health. A
                    key element of current efforts to protect and restore the lagoon's
                    seagrasses is the improved management of freshwater discharges and their
                    associated pollutant loadings. Multiple entities are engaged in the design
                    and implementation of projects aimed at reducing and better managing the
                    quantity and quality of freshwater entering the estuary. The scale of
                    these projects ranges from modest to very large, and from local to
                    regional.</p>

                <p class="body">Artificial salinity fluctuations, elevated nutrient levels, and excessive
                    muck deposits are all the result of an extensive man-made drainage system
                    that delivers large quantities of fresh water and associated pollutants to
                    the lagoon. Abatement actions aimed at correcting these issues share the
                    common goal of reducing the volume of fresh water discharged to the lagoon.</p>

                <p class="title">Hydrology Initiatives</p>
                <p class="body">The largest IRL hydrological restoration project contemplated to date is
                    the long-delayed, recently commenced Indian River Lagoon-South project, a
                    critical component of the $8 billion, 30-year Comprehensive Everglades
                    Restoration Plan (CERP). The goal of the CERP is to restore, protect and
                    preserve the water resources of central and southern Florida, including the
                    Everglades.</p>

                <p class="body">The Indian River Lagoon-South project is a large-scale freshwater
                    rediversion. Its intent is to improve water quality and mediate salinity
                    fluctuations within the St. Lucie Estuary (SLE) and the southern Indian
                    River Lagoon by reducing total and peak freshwater discharges and by
                    reducing nutrient, pesticide, and pollutant loads. The <a
                            href="http://141.232.10.32/pm/projects/proj_07_irl_south.aspx" target="new">Indian River
                        Lagoon-South project plan</a>: 1) includes
                    170,000 acre-feet of water storage (reservoirs C-44, C-23 and 24 North and
                    South, and C-25) and storm water treatment areas (C-44, C-23, C-24 and
                    C-25); 2) provides water storage on 37,000 ha (92,000 acres) of natural
                    storage areas (Allapattah, Palmar, and Cypress Creek); and 3) removes more
                    than 8 million cubic meters of muck from the St. Lucie River and Estuary.</p>

                <p class="title">Stormwater Abatement</p>
                <p class="body">Stormwater mitigation programs exist at several levels. At the local
                    level, municipal governments in the lagoon region have stormwater utilities
                    charged with developing and implementing plans to address flooding,
                    stormwater systems operation, and water quality. The local governments are
                    also subject to the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
                    stormwater permiting program authorized by the Clean Water Act to regulate
                    stormwater discharge to surface waters.</p>

                <p class="body">One of the current stormwater management initiatives being implemented along the entire
                    lagoon is the installation of large sediment traps, sometimes
                    called &quot;baffle boxes,&quot; designed to capture suspended sediments and
                    particulate debris and remove them before they reach the lagoon via the
                    drainage network (IRLNEP 2006).</p>

                <p class="body">The Water Management Districts operating within the IRL watershed have
                    undertaken development of specific Pollutant Load Reduction Goals (PLRGs)
                    for the lagoon, while the Florida Department of Environmental Protection
                    (FDEP) is charged with establishing Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL)
                    requirements for pollutants. The water quality standards established by
                    these agencies will be based on the ecological needs for a healthy IRL
                    seagrass community. Once set, programs and projects will be developed and
                    implemented to meet the new standards (SJRWMD 2007).</p>

                <p class="title">Nutrient Loading Reduction</p>
                <p class="body">In 1990, a big step was taken toward reducing point source nutrient loading
                    when the state legislature passed the Indian River Lagoon Act. This act
                    mandated that domestic wastewater treatment plants cease discharging their
                    effluents to the lagoon by July 1996. Elimination of this input source has
                    greatly reduced the amount of pollutants discharged to the IRL (SJRWMD
                    2007). Public education initiatives have also increased public awareness
                    of the nutrient impacts of yard fertilizer runoff and septic system
                    discharge.</p>

                <p class="title">Muck Removal and Preemption</p>
                <p class="body">A number of muck dredge-removal projects, both current and planned, will
                    augment the normal maintenance dredging of the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW) and navigational
                    channels within the IRL and will also remove large amounts of muck. Although dredging
                    can temporarily elevate turbidity and release trapped nutrients, removal
                    projects managed to minimize unintended side-effects will continue to
                    improve habitat quality in the estuary.</p>

                <p class="body">In addition to removing existing deposits, important steps are being taken
                    to reduce the input of new deposits. The primary sources of muck are poor
                    erosion control practices and decayed plant material. The installation of
                    stormwater sediment traps and the recent implementation of improved best
                    management practices for new construction has slowed the rate of
                    deposition.</p>

                <p class="title">Addressing Biotoxins</p>
                <p class="body">Several initiatives have been undertaken to address the biotoxin issues
                    affecting the lagoon (IRLNEP 2006). A Biotoxin and Aquatic Animal Health
                    Working Group was formed in 2005 to study current health issues affecting
                    lagoon fauna. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission's
                    Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute has also begun to look for a
                    connection between invertebrate disease and exposure to saxitoxin.
                    Additionally, an ongoing collaborative monitoring project conducted by the
                    University of Florida, the Florida Space Research Institute, and the
                    Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute is aimed at tracking the
                    occurrence and distribution of harmful algal blooms in the lagoon.</p>
