                    Lagoons are shallow coastal bodies of water separated from the ocean by a series of barrier
                    islands which lie parallel to the shoreline. Inlets, either natural or
                    man-made, cut through
                    barrier islands and permit tidal currents to transport water into and out of
                    the lagoons. Because lagoons are characteristically shallow, they are strongly influenced by
                    precipitation and
                    evaporation, which results in fluctuating water temperature and salinity. Lagoons can also be
                    fragile ecosystems susceptible to pollution effects from municipal, industrial and agricultural
                    runoff.
                    Lagoons
                    are classified into 3 main types: leaky lagoons, choked lagoons, and
                    restricted lagoons. Leaky lagoons have wide tidal channels, fast currents
                    and unimpaired exchange of water with the ocean. Choked lagoons occur
                    along high energy coastlines and have one or more long narrow
                    channels which restrict water exchange with the ocean. Circulation within this
                    type of lagoon is dominated by wind patterns. Restricted lagoons have
                    multiple channels, well defined exchange with the ocean, and tend to show a net
                    seaward transport of water. Wind patterns in restricted lagoons can also cause
                    surface currents to develop, thus helping to transport large volumes of water
                    downwind (Kjerfve 1986). The Indian River Lagoon is a restricted type
                    lagoon (Smith 1987, 1990).</p></td>

                                IRL tend to be well mixed because they are heavily influenced by wind
                                patterns. Winds enhance vertical mixing in the water column, and
                                also influence surface currents that insure lateral mixing of
                                estuarine water (Figure A). This results in a vertical profile of
                                the water column where virtually no change in salinity is observed from
                                the surface to the bottom. In contrast, salinity in
                                well mixed estuaries does decrease horizontally with distance from the
                                ocean (Figure B).</p></td>

                                properties of lagoons may change depending on its size and physical
                                characteristics. The Indian River Lagoon, for example, is
                                significantly longer than it is wide. The
                                southern portion of the lagoon exchanges water with the ocean through
                                3 jettied inlets (Sebastian, Fort
                                Pierce, St. Lucie), all of which differ in size. These and other
                                features have led researchers to delimit 3 sub-basins in the
                                IRL (Figure C). The southern sub-basin is defined as the area between St. Lucie
                                Inlet and Fort Pierce Inlet; the central sub-basin lies between Fort
                                Pierce Inlet and Sebastian Inlet; and the northern sub-basin is the
                                area north of Sebastian Inlet.

                                Each of the sub-basins
                                in the IRL experiences
                                somewhat different tidal amplitudes, current speeds, and tidal excursion (the horizontal
                                transport distance associated with either ebb or flood tide). Data
                                from studies by Pitts (1989), Smith (1990) and Liu (1992) have shown that
                                tidal amplitude, current speed and tidal excursion are all lowest in the
                                northern sub-basin, and increase to the south. One important exception to
                                this pattern occurs around inlets. In these areas, current speeds during
                                maximum ebb or flood tides can exceed 1 m/sec<sup>-1</sup> due to the constricting
                                effects of narrow inlet channels.</p>
                            <p class="body">It is important to note that although tidal forcing is important near
                                inlets mouths, volume transport in the interior of the Indian River Lagoon
                                is principally a wind driven process (Pitts 1989 Smith 1990 Liu 1992). The shallow
                                nature of coastal lagoons, combined
                                with the constricting effects of inlets aid in decreasing tidal transport
                                as distance from the inlet increases. Thus, wind becomes the primary transport process
                                in the interior of the Indian River Lagoon.</p>
