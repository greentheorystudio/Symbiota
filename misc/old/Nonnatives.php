                <p class="body">Non-native species are species that have been
                    introduced into new areas that have not historically been part of their native
                    range. 'Exotic,' 'alien,' 'nonindigenous,' and 'introduced' are all
                    synonymous terms referring to non-native species. In contrast, native species
                    are species that have historically occurred as part of an
                    ecosystem in a specific location. Native species are also called indigenous
                    species. Introduction is defined by
                    Krueger and May (1991) as the transfer by humans of an organism outside its
                    native range.</p>
                <p class="body">Plants and animals have been transported by humans and introduced into new
                    areas for many centuries. Some of these introductions have been intentional,
                    although a great many have not. Intentional introductions are often for
                    purposes of livestock or agricultural production, e.g., introduction of
                    domesticated cattle, goats, swine, and honeybees
                    from Europe to the New World in centuries past.</p>

                <p class="body">Many intentional introductions of cultivated stocks and crops have, of course,
                    been of great economic benefit. Hundreds of
                    nonindigenous plants and animals have been introduced to Florida in the five
                    centuries
                    since the arrival of the first European settlers and many of these have greatly
                    benefited man. For example, the cultivated plants of genus <i>Citrus</i>
                    originated in tropical to subtropical southeast Asia, India, and the Near East
                    and were introduced to Florida and the New World by Spanish explorer Ponce de
                    Leon in 1513. The various modern hybrid citrus cultivars-including the
                    world-famous "Indian River Citrus" varieties-now represent a billion-dollar
                    industry in the state.</p>

                <p class="body">Unfortunately, not all species introductions have proven beneficial.
                    Whether intentionally released to the environment, intentionally introduced and
                    then accidentally released, or introduced entirely by accident, the negative
                    ecological and economic impacts of exotic species introduction are substantial.
                    Very often, the invaders go largely unnoticed until populations have grown and
                    spread to a point where eradication is difficult and costly, or even
                    impossible. The most infamous such invasion in recent memory in North America
                    is that of the zebra mussel (<i>Dreissena polymorpha</i>) in the Great Lakes. In
                    Florida, the introduction and spread of the green mussel
                    (<a href="../../taxa/index.php?taxon=Perna viridis"><i>Perna viridis</i></a>) in
                    Tampa Bay is a prime example of an exotic introduction that has had substantial
                    ecological and economic impacts.</p>

                <p class="title">What Makes a Successful Invader?</p>
                <p class="body">Exotic species have the potential to become invasive when they are released
                    into a new environment. Invasive nonindigenous species are those species whose
                    introduction causes, or is likely to cause, significant economic or environmental
                    harm. Not all non-native species become invasive when released to novel
                    systems. In fact, the majority of individual introduction events are believed
                    to be of little consequence, with the introduced individuals failing to lead to
                    established populations. In other cases, the introduced species does become
                    established but, for reasons not entirely understood, its presence causes
                    little or no ecological or economic impact.</p>

                </table>
                <p class="body">Nevertheless, any species removed from its native range and introduced to a new
                    area has the potential to become an invasive species. The newly-introduced
                    organisms now exist free from the natural forces that keep populations in check
                    within their native range. Such natural forces include predators, competitors,
                    parasites, and diseases that the species co-evolved with, as well as
                    environmental factors and other natural control mechanisms (Torchin et al.
                    2003, Wolfe 2002). When an introduced species is released from these controls,
                    populations may become established and to grow unchecked to the
                    point where they achieve invasive species status. When this occurs, unchecked
                    invasive populations may compete with or otherwise negatively impact native
                    populations, displacing them in some instances.</p>
                <p class="body">
                    There are certain biological traits that together determine the capacity for a
                    non-native organism to become invasive. Organisms with wide habitat and/or
                    dietary preferences, broad physiological tolerances across a range of
                    environmental conditions, and relatively short generation times may be
                    predisposed to become successful invasives. Organisms that are abundant (but not
                    rampant) over large portions of their native ranges and those with a high degree
                    of genetic variability may also become successful invasives on release to novel
                    environments (Erlich 1989, Williams and Meffe 1999).</p>

                <p class="body">The ability to act as a pioneering species-among the earliest to occupy
                    available ecological niches and to establish 'founder' populations-is another
                    trait shared by several successful invasive species. These organisms typically
                    exhibit high fecundity such that release of only a few individuals can give
                    rise to a population sizeable enough to establish itself in its new setting.</p>

                <p class="body">It is important to bear in mind that although we can recognize many of the
                    traits that allow introduced species to become invasive, predicting which
                    species actually will become invasive in a new setting remains difficult.
                    This is a key reason why the intentional introduction of non-native species,
                    either for commercial purposes or as a means of biocontrol to manage other
                    ecological invaders, is undertaken only after years of careful study has
                    shown the invasive potential for the new species to be minimal.</p>

                <p class="body">Although predicting which introduced species will eventually become invasive is
                    difficult, identifying the sorts of habitats most likely to be invaded is
                    somewhat less so. Habitats most susceptible to invasion tend to have low
                    natural biological diversity, simple food webs, and a degree of vulnerability
                    to natural or man-made disturbance (Williams and Meffe 1999, Ray 2005).</p>

                <p class="body">Agricultural lands, managed forests, and variously urbanized habitats all share
                    the above traits, and all are susceptible to exotic invasion. But sheltered
                    coastlines and estuaries are also vulnerable to invasion, and these systems
                    also tend to have a relatively low diversity and usually suffer from
                    anthropogenic disturbance (Ray 2005).</p>

                <p class="title">Florida and the Indian River Lagoon</p>
                <p class="body">Florida is one of the two states most affected by invasive species, second only
                    to Hawaii. Both states share features that make them particularly susceptible
                    to bioinvasion.</p>

                </table>

                <p class="body">Simberloff (1986, 1997) notes that two sorts of sites particularly prone to
                    invasion impacts are islands and habitats created or greatly disturbed by
                    humans. Hawaii, an oceanic island archipelago whose lowlands are heavily
                    impacted by human disturbance and development, contains an abundance of both
                    types of sites. The situation in Florida is strikingly similar. South Florida
                    is effectively a habitat island, bounded to the east, south, and west by ocean,
                    and on to the north by winter low temperatures. Like true oceanic islands, the
                    habitats of south Florida are typified by an impoverished native flora and
                    fauna which leaves them vulnerable to negative impacts from invasive
                    populations (Myers and Ewel 1990). With a resident population of 17 million
                    people and growing, and several times that number visiting each year, much of
                    Florida is dominated by habitats created or extensively modified by humans.</p>

                <p class="body">Also similar to
                    Hawaii, large expanses of tropical to subtropical habitats add to Florida's
                    vulnerability to invasive species impact. The subtropical to tropical climate
                    and the high seasonal rainfall are two climatological factors that
                    foster the establishment of tropical nonindigenous species, particularly
                    terrestrial plants (McCann et al. 1996).</p>

                </table>

                <p class="body">Large numbers of tropical exotic species were first introduced to the state as
                    ornamental plants or pets. Accidental or intentional release of these
                    organisms to adjacent ecologically accommodating natural areas in south Florida
                    gives them a foot in the door toward establishing self-sustaining populations.
                    South Florida is more susceptible to invasion than north Florida, and the
                    effects of invasion are more apparent. In fact, many south Florida invasive
                    populations have a distribution whose northern extent terminates abruptly at
                    approximately the latitude where winter freeze events are commonly recorded
                    (Simberloff 1997).</p>

                <p class="body">Another factor contributing to the invasive exotic crisis in Florida is the
                    fact that the state is an important transportation and shipping hub. Fully 85%
                    of the hundreds of millions of live plants imported to the U.S. utilized Miami
                    as the port of entry (Simberloff 1997). Most of the exotic animals shipped to
                    the U.S. for the pet trade also pass through Florida.</p>

                <p class="body">Certainly, the vast Florida coastline, at almost 3,000 km, offers marine
                    invaders ample opportunity to gain a foothold in coastal and inshore habitats.
                    Finally, seasonal tropical storms common to Florida can facilite the spread of
                    exotics in the state by physically dispersing individuals or propagules (McCann
                    et al. 1996).</p>

                <p class="body">Noted entomologist and conservation biologist E. O. Wilson, in his foreword to
                    the book, <i>Strangers in Paradise: Impact and Management of Nonindigenous
                        Species in Florida</i>, eloquently summed up the invasion status of the state
                    and what is at stake:</p>
                <p class="body"><i>What is being lost? The answer is easy. A precious and irreplaceable part of

                        entire ecosystems that took tens of thousands to millions of years to evolve
                        are at risk. What is being gained in their place? A hodgepodge of species
                        found in other parts of the world, in some cases all around the world in
                        tropical and subtropical environments. . . . Florida is being homogenized, and
                        everyone, for all time to come, will be the poorer for it.</i></p>

                <p class="body">Turning attention specifically to the Indian River Lagoon (IRL) region of
                    east-central Florida, a number of features leave the system vulnerable to
                    exotic invasion. The long and narrow coastal IRL straddles climatic provinces
                    (subtropical to warm-temperate) and also straddles land and sea. Open
                    communication with the Atlantic Ocean occurs via five inlets that cut through
                    the barrier island, while an extensive network of canals drains upland portions
                    of the watershed into the lagoon. At a glance, then, it is apparent that the
                    IRL and its watershed offer would-be invaders a broad range of environmental
                    conditions as well as means of entry, whether by land, surface water, or sea.
                    Beyond these geographical considerations, the IRL is an urbanized estuary
                    situated on the densely populated Florida east coast. Recall that human
                    disturbance typically predisposes an area to bioinvasion.</p>
                <p class="body">We need also consider the mix of regional commercial land uses (e.g.,
                    agriculture, ornamental aquaculture), and outdoor recreational activities
                    (e.g., fishing and boating) that have the potential to act as vectors for the
                    introduction of new species. Consider the ease with which recreational boaters
                    can transport marine invaders large distances when they trailer boats up and
                    down the coast or between Florida's Gulf and Atlantic coasts.</p>
                <div class="clear"></div>

                <p class="body">With the above considerations in mind, it can only be assumed that unintentional new
                    species introductions are occurring all the time in the IRL watershed and are a
                    very real and ongoing threat to ecosystem structure and function.</p>

                <p class="title">By Land and By Sea: Introduction Pathways</p>
                <p class="body">Several known or suspected non-native species introduction pathways are
                    described here, and some of the species likely to have been transported via
                    each pathway are noted. The actual invasion pathways for
                    many nonindigenous species remain unknown and that species are likely to
                    have arrived via a number of different pathways and multiple introduction
                    events. Additionally, the original native range of many species is not known
                    with certainty. Species with unknown geographical origins are often referred
                    to as 'cryptogenic' species.</p>

                <p class="title">Intentional release for human benefit</p>

                <p class="body">A number of nonindigenous plants and animals have been directly introduced into
                    new locations in order to derive some benefit resulting from the introduction.
                    The widespread introduction of the Asian oyster (<i>Crassostrea gigas</i>) throughout
                    much of the world in an effort to augment or replace depleted native species
                    fisheries is a well-known marine example of such an introduction. Introduction
                    of European brown trout (<i>Salmo trutta</i>) to new locations in order to establish
                    sport fisheries is a freshwater example. The honeybees (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) that
                    are of nearly incalculable economic and agricultural value in Florida and
                    elsewhere in the U.S. are descended from European honeybees brought to the New
                    World some 300 ago.</p>

                <p class="body">Ballast refers to any heavy material used to improve
                    stability and control of a vessel. In a cargo
                    vessel laden with goods, most of the ballast is provided by the cargo stowed in
                    the hold. When the cargo is offloaded, however, an equivalent mass of some
                    other material must be taken on to maintain stability. Prior to the 1880s,
                    rocks, sand, dirt, or other forms of 'dry ballast' were typically employed, but
                    for well over a century seawater has been primarily used as ballast.</p>

                <p class="body">Several centuries of transporting dry ballast across and between oceans spread
                    innumerable species of insects, wharf roaches (<a

                <p class="body">Ballast water pumped into a ship's hold at one location will contain adult-,
                    larval-, and propagule forms of a variety of water column and
                    sediment-associated organisms occurring in that location. When that ballast
                    water is pumped out at a new location perhaps several-thousand miles away, an
                    undetermined number of viable exotic organisms are pumped out as well. Ballast
                    water is the most important man-made, long range transport vector for marine
                    plankton, including the free-swimming planktonic larval stages of organisms
                    that as adults inhabit hardbottom and soft sediment intertidal and subtidal

                <p class="body">Occasionally, an exotic species comes to occur in a new area not through any of
                    the human-facilitated introduction pathways described above, but through
                    natural range extension. The initial appearance in Florida of the highly
                    migratory cattle egret (<a href="../../taxa/index.php?taxon=Bubulcus ibis"><i>Bubulcus ibis</i></a>),
                    native to Africa, appears to be a
                    largely natural occurrence unassisted by humans (Weber 1972, Kaufman 1996).
                    Similarly, the initial Florida panhandle population of nine-banded armadillos
                    (<i>Dasypus novemcinctus</i>) represented a natural westward range expansion of the
                    Texas armadillo population.</p>

                <p class="body">Although the initial occurrence of such animals in new areas may have taken place
                    in the absence of human helping hands, subsequent spread of these populations
                    may still be dependent on human activity. In the case of the cattle egret, for
                    example, range expansion in the U.S. subsequent to the arrival of the species
                    appears related to widespread landscape conversion to pasturelands (Telfair
                    1994).</p>

                <p class="title">Impacts and Consequences of Invasion</p>

                <p class="body">The ecological consequences of exotic species invasion are many and varied.
                    They include potential displacement of native species, modification of
                    community structure, alteration of food webs, and possible reduction in habitat
                    value. Invasive terrestrial plants may alter habitat hydrology and soil
                    make-up, and can affect natural fire regimes in fire-mediated ecosystems
                    (Mazzotti et al. 1997). Of utmost concern to conservation biologists is the
                    potential for loss of biological diversity when native species are outcompeted
                    by invasives and displaced from the ecosystems to which they may be uniquely
                    adapted.</p>

                <p class="body">Biological invasions carry serious economic and ecological consequences.
                    Nationwide, bioinvasions over the past two centuries have resulted in the
                    establishment of 50,000 foreign plant and animal species, with one of every
                    seven of these species becoming invasive. The United States Department of
                    Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has estimated the
                    national cost due to invasive species, including damage to crops and other
                    industries and the cost of management and control, at nearly $140 billion
                    annually (APHIS 2001).</p>

                <p class="title">Assessing the Invasion Status of the IRL Watershed</p>

                <p class="body">The efforts of the Indian River Lagoon Species Inventory Project authors during
                    the 2006-2007 funding cycle were primarily directed toward assessing the status
                    of the IRL region with regard to nonindigenous species. Each of the fifty new
                    species reports added to the inventory during this period summarizes the life
                    history, invasion history, and potential ecological and economic impacts of a
                    variety of non-native species occurring here and elsewhere in Florida.</p>

                <p class="body">Additionally, an initial atttempt was made to assess the native/non-native
                    status of the biota of the IRL region via examination of the relevant
                    literature and collection records. Though by no means exhaustive, this first
                    examination of the invasion status of the region identified approximately 240
                    species present in the region as either exotic or cryptogenic. Of these,
                    approximately 170 species represent organisms new to the Species Inventory.
