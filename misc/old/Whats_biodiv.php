            <td><p class="title">The Problem: Loss of Species</p>
                <p class="body">By the early 1980s, scientists around the world
                    had begun to recognize that species extinctions were occurring on a global
                    scale. The rate of these extinctions rivaled, or surpassed, those of the
                    Cretaceous period 65 million years ago when many species, including the dinosaurs became extinct.
                    The crisis facing species today differs in one
                    fundamental way from any other extinction events: all other cases of mass
                    extinction throughout global history have come about as the result of
                    climatic change, a natural geological change or some cataclysmic event.
                    The present crisis, however, is being driven by human influences.
                    Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, the scientific community, the media,
                    the public, and governmental agencies worldwide began working
                    to preserve the biological diversity of terrestrial systems. Issues
                    such as deforestation of tropical forests, overdevelopment,
                    overexploitation of species, pollution, habitat loss, invasions by
                    introduced species, and other issues which addressed habitat preservation
                    and conservation were brought into public focus. However, maintaining the biological diversity of
                    marine
                    and estuarine systems was largely overlooked throughout the 1980s, even
                    though it was generally accepted that marine systems are far more species
                    rich and have greater ecosystem diversity than terrestrial systems. Representatives from 32 of the
                    33 known animal phyla can be found in ocean and coastal waters. Of these, 15 phyla occur
                    exclusively in estuarine or marine environments.</p>

                <p class="title">Defining Biodiversity:</p>
                <p class="body">The vast wealth of life on earth is unified by a
                    common strand: DNA. All living things owe their forms and functions to the
                    molecular makeup of their DNA. But perhaps more intriguing than life's
                    unity is its immense diversity. Biological diversity - biodiversity - is
                    one of the central themes of conservation. But what exactly is biological
                    diversity, and why should we be concerned about preserving it? Simply put,
                    biodiversity may be defined as the measure of how healthy our ecosystems
                    are. Healthy ecosystems support high biological diversity; while stressed or highly disturbed
                    ecosystems do not. When we
                    consider biodiversity as a whole, we are actually addressing 3 main
                    components: genetic level biodiversity, species richness and ecosystem
                    diversity.</p>

                <p class="title">Genetic Level Biodiversity:</p>

                <p class="body">The term &quot;genetic diversity&quot; is the
                    most fundamental level of biodiversity, and refers to the degree of
                    variation in all the genes for all individuals within a species. Here we
                    will define a <b>species</b> as a group consisting of all the collected populations of
                    morphologically similar organisms which are able to
                    interbreed with one another. A <b>population</b> is defined as consisting
                    of all the individuals of the same species within a defined geographical area,
                    for example, the Indian River Lagoon.</p>
                <p class="body">Within a species, it is theoretically possible
                    for any individual to breed successfully with any other individual of the
                    species. However, populations,
                    tend to remain somewhat separated from each other. Thus, there is a higher
                    probability that an individual within a population will select a mate from
                    the same population. Within a large population, the effect of
                    geographic separation of populations, which often results in reduced genetic
                    mixing, is small. However, within small populations, there can be a tendency
                    toward reduced genetic diversity among members of that population. Over
                    long periods of time, this can lead to geographically separated
                    populations diverging genetically, each population having its own set of
                    genetic adaptations which allow it to live optimally within a particular habitat.</p>
                <p class="body">This genetic divergence is the basis for
                    evolution. Populations having greater genetic diversity are far better
                    equipped to cope with environmental change and go on to reproduce
                    successfully than populations with low genetic diversity. Populations with
                    low genetic diversity can become so well adapted to local conditions that any
                    environmental disturbance may be enough to reduce their numbers
                    dramatically, or even destroy them entirely. Thus, in thinking about
                    preserving biodiversity, one must consider that each population within a
                    species may have some unique set of genetic adaptations that could
                    potentially assist the entire species in overcoming environmental, or
                    human influenced challenges to its survival.</p>

                <p class="body">This term, quite simply, is the measure of the
                    number of species which occur within a particular taxonomic level (i.e.,
                    genus level, family level, etc.) in a
                    geographic area. In marine ecosystems, species diversity tends to vary
                    widely depending upon latitudinal and longitudinal location. Along a latitudinal gradient, species
                    diversity tends to increase toward tropical areas. Within tropical areas, species diversity tends to
                    increase
                    along a longitudinal gradient, with more species being found toward the
                    Indo-Pacific region around northeastern Australia, Indonesia and the
                    Philippines. There is a moderate amount of species diversity in the
                    eastern Pacific and western Atlantic oceans, with lowest species diversity
                    found in the eastern Atlantic.</p>

                <p class="title">Ecosystem Diversity:</p>

                <p class="body">Ecosystems are the collection of all the plants and
                    animals within a particular area, each differing in species composition, physical
                    structure and function. Even within highly diverse ecosystems, these
                    elements can differ widely. For example, most estuarine ecosystems, especially salt
                    marshes, generally have high <a href="#primary production"
                                                    onClick="popDef('The manufacture of organic compounds produced by plants as the result of photosynthesis', '#primary production');"
                                                    Name="primary production">primary production</a>. Coral reefs, an
                    entirely
                    different type of ecosystem, must rely on the efficient recycling of
                    nutrients in order to maintain high productivity. Deep sea ecosystems,
                    while rich in species, have no primary production because sunlight does
                    not penetrate such vast depths.</p>

                <p class="title">Threats to Biodiversity:</p>

                <p class="body">The factors which threaten biodiversity in
                    estuaries and in the oceans are generally the same as those which affect
                    biodiversity in terrestrial systems: overexploitation, physical alteration of habitat
                    areas, alien species introductions, and changes in atmospheric composition. Many
                    threats to the survival of life in the oceans (i.e., siltation, nutrient
                    loading, pollution of air and water by toxic chemicals, etc) can originate on
                    land. Also threatening marine ecosystems, particularly coastal and
                    estuarine systems, is the continuous increase in the size of human
                    populations, wasteful resource consumption, lack of knowledge, and poor
                    management. Habitat degradation which occurs as the result of these problems,
                    inevitably leads to loss of species from an ecosystem, and thus, a loss of
                    biodiversity.</p>

                <p class="title">The Solution: Preserving Biodiversity:</p>
                <p class="body">In order to insure biological diversity in
                    both marine and terrestrial systems, we must finally recognize the fact that our natural resource
                    base,
                    our economic development, our food, our medicine, our clothing, the air we
                    breathe, indeed our very existence on this planet is dependent on the life
                    around us. In preserving biological diversity, we are simply insuring our
                    own continued prosperity and survival.</p>
