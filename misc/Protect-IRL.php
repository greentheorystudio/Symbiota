                    all of us who live within its watershed on a daily basis. Critical to IRL&rsquo;s remarkable
                    biodiversity is its water quality. Why is water quality so important? Maintaining high standards of
                    water quality, among other things, supports healthy seagrass beds. Seagrasses serve a vital role in
                    the ecology of the IRL. Not only do healthy seagrass beds oxygenate the water column and stabilize
                    sediments, but perhaps most importantly, they also provide a critical nursery and refuge area for
                    juvenile fish and invertebrates, many of which are commercially important. Seagrasses also serve as
                    a food source for many IRL inhabitants either directly (e.g., <em>Thalassia testudinum </em>consumed
                    by sea turtles) or indirectly (epiphytes living on seagrass blades consumed by small fish and
                    invertebrates).</p>
                <p class="body">Negative impacts of poor water quality include declining seagrass beds and shellfish
                    harvests as well as an increase in harmful algal blooms and fish kills. Keep in mind that if your
                    home occurs within the IRL watershed (see Fig. 2), you have a direct effect on its water
                    quality.</p></td>

            <td><p class="body">Indiscriminate use of fertilizers results in deteriorating water quality in the Indian
                    River Lagoon as well as waterways everywhere. Fertilizers are composed primarily of nitrogen,
                    phosphorus and potassium which are the major components required for plant growth. These chemicals,
                    when improperly used, can have significant adverse effects on the environment.</p>

                <p class="body">Although fertilizers can temporarily make a lawn look greener, they are far too often
                    applied incorrectly. Instead of being incorporated into plant tissue, excess nutrients work their
                    way into the lagoon directly through stormwater runoff or indirectly by seeping through the soil
                    into groundwater. When in the lagoon, these nutrients stimulate blooms of micro-algae (i.e.,
                    phytoplankton) as well as the proliferation of other aquatic plants. Blooms of certain species of
                    phytoplankton can create what are known as harmful algal blooms, i.e., &quot;HABs&quot;. HABs can
                    produce potent toxins that can have negative health consequences for both humans as well as marine
                    organisms.</p>

                <p class="body">Eutrophication is a process in aquatic systems that describes the subsequent decay of
                    rapidly growing plant material consuming available oxygen, thus creating hypoxic conditions that
                    threaten other plants and animals in the ecosystem. Larval and juvenile stages of fish and
                    invertebrates can be particularly sensitive to eutrophication. This decaying organic material
                    eventually settles to the bottom and, along with fine particles of silt and clay, creates a low
                    oxygen (hypoxic) layer often called muck. Hypoxic conditions can affect biodiversity by causing the
                    demise of species normally found in an area while promoting the growth of opportunistic species that
                    thrive in low oxygen environments. Muck can easily be resuspended and further affect water quality
                    and clarity. Dense phytoplankton blooms (harmful or otherwise) can also physically decrease the
                    amount of light penetrating the water column and thus pose as an additional threat to healthy
                    seagrass growth.</p>

                    sidewalks and rooftops as well as from saturated fields and slopes lacking vegetation, is collected
                    by storm drains, swales (shallow, grassy channels that collect stormwater from streets and
                    sidewalks) and retention ponds. This stormwater runoff often enters canals and tributaries that
                    drain directly into the Indian River Lagoon (Fig. 4). For example, it is estimated that 75 billion
                    gallons of stormwater runoff in Brevard County makes its way into the IRL annually. Carried with
                    this runoff are pollutants such as heavy metals, fertilizers, sediments, animal wastes, oil and
                    grease from roadways ,anti-freeze, pesticides, household chemicals, bacteria, and an array of

                    primary source of pollution in the IRL today and poses the biggest threat to its water quality. A
                    common misconception hindering individual efforts to lessen the effects of this pollution source is
                    that many of us think that water entering storm drains is initially directed to wastewater
                    facilities for treatment. This is not the case.</p>

                    waste poses a major bacterial pollution threat to the Indian River Lagoon when it enters local
                    waterways and works its way into the IRL via stormwater runoff.</p>
                <p class="body">The Humane Society of the United States estimates that 39% of all households own at
                    least one dog. Based on this national trend, it is estimated that in Brevard County alone, there are
                    approximately 104,832 dogs. Dogs produce about one pound of waste per day. This material contains
                    fecal coliform bacteria (one gram of dog waste contains about 23 million coliform bacteria)
                    including salmonella. This material may also contain viruses and parasites such as roundworms,
                    hookworms and tapeworms. Many of these organisms present a potential human health hazard and can
                    cause severe cramping and diarrhea, particularly in children and the elderly. These organisms can
                    linger in the soil for years if associated animal waste is not disposed of properly. In urban areas,
                    dog waste is also a potential source of food for mice and rats. Rodents can carry a host of harmful
                    bacteria and be a source of ticks and fleas.</p>
                <p class="body">Some people are reluctant to pick up after their pets for a variety of reasons:
                    inconvenience; unsightliness; odor, etc. Although more than 60 % of dog owners do pick up after
                    their four-legged friends, it is estimated that in the five county region surrounding the Indian
                    River Lagoon, every day, as much as 167,530 pounds (84 tons) of dog feces is left on the ground in
                    backyards, sidewalks and streets. In addition, some misinformed citizens will dispose of animal
                    waste directly into waterways and/or storm drains. Since most stormwater is not treated before
                    flowing into canals and local waterways, bacteria and other organisms in neglected or improperly
                    disposed of pet waste can directly threaten commercial and recreational fishing, shellfishing,
                    boating, and swimming in the Indian River Lagoon. Nutrients associated with pet waste can also cause
                    the proliferation of phytoplankton and macro-algae with additional, adverse effects on the IRL
                    ecosystem (see above).</p></td>

                    Landscaping increases the aesthetic and curb appeal of our dwellings and enhances property value.
                    Florida&rsquo;s nursery and landscaping industry is big business, significantly affecting Florida&rsquo;s
                    economy by creating thousands of jobs and impacting labor income. In 2005, landscape sales topped
                    $5.25 billion and sales from retail garden centers were estimated at $6.97 billion. The practice of
                    planting the right plant in the right place can be consistent with promoting these economic
                    benefits.</p>
                <p class="body">The idea behind using the right plant in the right place is to choose landscaping plants
                    that fit best into existing site conditions, thus minimizing the use of fertilizers, pesticides,
                    irrigation and labor. When these commonly used &ldquo;backyard chemicals&rdquo; are eliminated, or
                    applied at minimal rates, and less water is used for irrigation (waterwise landscaping), the
                    likelihood of these chemicals reaching the Indian River Lagoon through stormwater runoff and
                    adversely affecting IRL water quality decreases.</p>
                <p class="body"> In fact, one of the biggest uses of water in Florida is for lawn and landscape
                    irrigation. Because of ever changing cycles in Florida&rsquo;s natural water supply, water
                    conservation through waterwise landscaping in conjunction with prudent use of fertilizers and
                    pesticides is something we should all strive to achieve.</p>
